<p>Time to recap the life portion of the school life balance from last week!</p>

<p>Monday at the gym ALL OF THE DUMBBELLS WERE THERE. I have never seen this before. People suck at picking up after themselves&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/m.gym.jpg" alt="gym" /></p>

<p>Tuesday night we grilled on the roof. We were hoping to catch some Tennis up there on the TV- but apparently our complex has different subscriptions in different rooms.. So after, we ended up back in the apartment subscribing to tennis channel&hellip;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/t.roof.jpg" alt="Rooftop" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/t.roof2.jpg" alt="Rooftop" /></p>

<p>This week I have a cautionary tale for meal prepping&hellip; I tend to use the same meals throughout the week. It makes shopping, prepping and cooking easier. But this week, I felt AWFUL after eating lunch on Monday. Due to food or not, I just couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to eat the food I had prepped. Ugh- what a waste. I learned a lesson, and when I meal plan this week for Quarter two, I&rsquo;ll be incorporating some variety through the week.</p>

<p>So- food was basic- and I found a new combination I LOVE. My favorite Wegmans Granola and Coconut Noosa. Noosa is becoming my FAVORITE, slowly taking over my Chobani flip obsession.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/m.yogurt.jpg" alt="yogurt" /></p>

<p>My new Micron pens came in this week! I can&rsquo;t wait to start playing with them and some typography books. You know, when I have a second of free time again lol.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/w.micron.jpg" alt="pens" /></p>

<p>It has been so great to have Zac home. We&rsquo;re getting totally spoiled.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/w.dog.jpg" alt="CAD" /></p>

<p>Thursday was REALLY exciting. First, my project in school was done- but after school we had a dinner and movie date!</p>

<p>We decided to go to a well known restaurant in downtown called Guard and Grace. It was wonderful. Everything was so good. I got a glass of red wine, a house salad and a 4 oz filet. If you want a steak in Denver, I highly recommend!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/r.dinner.jpg" alt="dinner" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/r.dinner2.jpg" alt="dinner" /></p>

<p>I totally bought tickets to Beauty and the Beast a month before it came out! IT WAS SO GOOD! AHHH! I CAN&rsquo;T WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN. I&rsquo;ll be preordering that one&hellip;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/r.beauty.jpg" alt="Beauty and the Beast" /></p>

<p>Friday was the official start to break. I got home around 3:30- and sat in the sun, started my new Shades of Magic book and started relaxing!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/f.book.jpg" alt="book" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/f.dog.jpg" alt="dog" /></p>

<p>We cooked up on the roof again- enjoyed dinner in sun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/f.dinner.jpg" alt="dinner" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/f.roof.jpg" alt="rooftop" /></p>

<p>About 4 hours later I had Atom open starting a new project, because, who takes a real break?</p>

<p>Saturday morning I made bacon and apple omelettes. I LOVE putting apples in with the bacon. Seriously, it&rsquo;s a great combination.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/s.breakfast.jpg" alt="breakfast" /></p>

<p>Then we went to Aurora for a bike sale. Didn&rsquo;t find anything we needed, and so we headed to Cherry Creek so Zac could order his tux for the upcoming wedding.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/s.cherry.jpg" alt="Cherry Creek" /></p>

<p>After we got back, Zac went on a bike ride ( I NEED TO GET MY SHIT TOGETHER AND GO! - <strong>clip in pedal problems</strong> ). I got some snaps from my cohort that there was a housewarming party about .5 miles away from where I live- so I popped over to say hi and meet some people. Hot Dudes Reading was on the table- FTW.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/s.house.jpg" alt="HDR" /></p>

<p>Saturday we decided to go for an easy hike. We have some goals this year- and should start training easy. We headed up to <a href="http://dayhikesneardenver.com/glendale-farm-trail-douglas-county-open-space/">Glendale</a> to do a quick loop. After, we went into the off leash area and let Rex trot around.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/u.glendale.jpg" alt="Hike" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/u.off.jpg" alt="Hike" /></p>

<p>When we got home, I made Coffee Smoothies. I didn&rsquo;t measure, but it was something like this:
- .5 Cup Almond Milk
- 1.5 Cup Coffee
- 2T Peanut Butter
- 2 Scoops Vanilla Protein
- 1T coffee grounds</p>

<p>They were really good. Will be making more in the future, and playing with the ingredients!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/u.coffee.jpg" alt="smoothie" /></p>

<p>We grilled dinner, again, of course, &lsquo;TIS THE SEASON!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_21/u.grill.jpg" alt="grill" /></p>

<p>Book Update is that A Conjuring of Light is AMAZING. All the feels, already. LOVE THIS WORLD.</p>
