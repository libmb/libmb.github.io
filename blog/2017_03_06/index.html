<p>HACK THE PLANET WAS SO MUCH FUN.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/hacktheplanet.png" alt="Logo for Hack the Planet" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/me.jpg" alt="Selfie" /></p>

<p>So Saturday I participated in my FIRST EVER HACKATHON. It was also the first ever gSchool hackathon. The event started around 8:30, but I showed up early to get put into a team. Since I&rsquo;m still new to this world, and the event wanted to encourage cross cohort/location collaboration- I decided to go in as a single and get paired up with a group.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/team.jpg" alt="Group Pic" /></p>

<p>And it worked out really great! Look at this crew. Molly is in g46 with me, two teammates are in g41 (about a month ahead of us), and one team member is a data science student. We were pretty well rounded.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/molly.jpg" alt="Molly and I" /></p>

<p>After everyone was grouped up- we got the rules from Josh! Goal was to use a NASA API and make a web app&ndash; they amended this later to be any API (because reasons I don&rsquo;t know..?).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/rules.jpg" alt="Josh giving rules" /></p>

<p>At 9:30 we got started. We brainstormed a bunch of ideas until one clicked. Molly had taken a meteorology class in undergrad, and her teacher watched the forecast for hail. He would collect it and make margaritas- according to him they make the best because they have ozone in them. Our idea- Hail Ya! was born.</p>

<p>The concept was to pull weather data- and plan a margarita party around forecasted hail!</p>

<p>First hiccup was that there was no hail forecasted in the US for, like, ever. Winter? SO we switched gears-  a web app that would pull 1. your location and 2. the weather forecast. We would pull the precipitation type and tell you what kind of drink to make based on what &ldquo;natural&rdquo; ingredients you could use!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/diagram.jpg" alt="whiteboard planning" /></p>

<p>We split off- and I started working on design. With the time crunch, I decided to go with <em>what I knew</em> and so you can see- it mirrors what I created for this blog!:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/hailcomp.jpg" alt="picture of computer" /></p>

<p>I created 4 recipes based on the results for rain, snow, sun and the ultimate goal: hail!</p>

<p>At 1:30 (pizza was delivered at noon), I wrapped up the design pieces and started collaborating on the CSS/HTML pages. At 3pm, we had finished our forms and layout.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/screenform.png" alt="Finished form" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/screenresult.png" alt="Finished result page" /></p>

<p>Then it was crunch time. Submission was due at 4:30 and we were struggling to get the last functions working.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/struggle.jpg" alt="struggles" /></p>

<p>With minutes left we finished, and with seconds left we cleaned up our merge files and pushed our product to Github!</p>

<p>Then it was time to present- we were up first, which was actually awesome. I don&rsquo;t have a picture of us, but I do have one of the team that won (they did AWESOME):</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_06/present.jpg" alt="Winning team presentation" /></p>

<p>Seriously everyone did awesome. It was great to sit back and see what everyone had created- what they came up with and how they executed it! There wasn&rsquo;t a single bad project.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t win, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have changed anything. I had a great time with my team. I take away this: TIME FLIES SO FAST. I can&rsquo;t believe we were there, seriously working, for 8 hours. But I also can&rsquo;t believe what we were able to accomplish either.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited for the next round- and to find a Hackathon I can enter with Zac.</p>

<p><strong>To end, I slept over 10 hours Saturday night.</strong></p>
