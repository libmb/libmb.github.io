<p>Wow, what a week! It seriously FLEW by. First, I&rsquo;ll review some pictures from the week, then get into the nitty gritty of projects&hellip;.</p>

<p>After the weekend, I decided that Monday was the best day to bring Rex into class. It works for our schedule, and fits better with the general flow at school. He only stayed a half day- because, projects. Also, HE SHAMED THE FAMILY by deciding to mark a classmates bag. UGH REX WTH, MAN! The guy was super generous and I still feel awful.</p>

<p>Monday morning we had a guest speaker- Dish Network! I only went because I was assured that I could sit in the back and do work - that it wouldn&rsquo;t be rude. I guess this is a good time to say that I did NOTHING special or extra this week. I didn&rsquo;t attend any meet ups or go to breakout sessions. It was a busy week, and I prioritized what I thought was best for me.</p>

<p>Pretty much all week I worked upstairs, getting sun and fresh air.</p>

<p>OK, BEFORE I jump into Friday, I&rsquo;ll cover the project.</p>

<p>Quarter one projects are the embodiment of what we&rsquo;ve learned this quarter. I submitted two ideas last Friday, and was directed to a certain one. What did I work on all week? GX!: Gifting Experiences. I decided to make something that was important to me, and perhaps would make life a little easier. I am really passionate about gifting experiences rather than material items- and in the past few years have gained some insight and experience in doing so. My idea was to create a web app that would allow a user to sort through gifts and return ones that fit with their scenario.</p>

<p>The requirements included: valid HTML, CSS, JavaScript and CSS Framework. Connect to at least one external API, and deploy to a production environment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_18/f.timeline.jpg" alt="timeline" /></p>

<p>So, it took me all week. I used two API&rsquo;s (for weather and location) and by Wednesday night, I had a MVP (minimal viable product). Thursday I cleaned it up- and Friday, presented! Being honest, it could use some work and in the future, I&rsquo;d like to do things differently (for instance, NOT use a CSS framework- but design the site myself).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_18/api.png" alt="Screen Shot" /></p>

<p>Top things I learned?: 1. Local storage! Whoop. 2. When generating ideas- consider how much of the outcome relies on your creating content. The main product of the web app I created was written rather than pulled. I could spend hours and hours updating that content to make it better; and the product is that content! In the future, I will highly consider that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_18/f.wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe" /></p>

<p>Friday was presentation day. We submitted our projects (Github, deployed and wireframes)- and spent about 2-3 minutes demo-ing our product. I was BLOWN AWAY by my awesome cohort. Like, way to go guys. After, we were released for lunch and to create a YouTube video tutorial. About an hour before we were due back for retro- we were all finished and a bunch of us sat outside at DBC across the street.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_18/f.DBC.jpg" alt="DBC" /></p>

<p>Then we did Retro.. and PROJECT WEEK WAS COMPLETE.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_18/f.retro.jpg" alt="RETRO" /></p>

<p>That means that I AM ON BREAK. One week. I <strong>plan</strong> on getting a lot done- we&rsquo;ll see!</p>
