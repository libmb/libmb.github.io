<p>Monday morning two classmates pulled together to bring in a BUNCH of doughnuts! They are for sure not on the plan- but I had one and it literally made me happy- so there&rsquo;s that. (ps. they were awesome for doing that).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/m.guest.jpg" alt="Guest Speaker" /></p>

<p>We started off the week with a guest speaker- a UX designer! It was a really interesting talk- and I appreciate seeing and hearing from different people in the tech field- who work in the various aspects of web development.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/model.jpg" alt="model map" /></p>

<p>Topic wise- we covered models and deployed to Firebase. It was a gentle way to start the week! (And I think Kiki is warming up to me!)</p>

<p>On Tuesdays, I get in early to do some side work with a classmate- we kind of review the things we&rsquo;ve gone over and talk about anything we&rsquo;re stuck on. I was first in the basement, so I made all the fresh coffee.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/t.coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee Pots" /></p>

<p>I also decided to take over our white boards. They were getting pretty messy and hard to read- so I decided to clean them up a bit and bring a little inspiration to the walls!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/t.board.jpg" alt="White boards" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/t.stars.jpg" alt="White Board image" /></p>

<p>Since I go in early, I have a really hard time eating breakfast before hand. I pretty much just suck at getting up in the morning. Luckily- I know myself and meal prep! SO I brought breakfast and enjoyed it in the classroom. (Overnight oats for the win).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/t.break.jpg" alt="Breakfast" /></p>

<p>Topic wise, we covered wireframes and closures</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/t.wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframing" /></p>

<p>I was feeling AWFUL on Tuesday. I actually contemplated leaving the entire day,  but my pain subsided after lunch and I pulled it off. Since I was feeling crappy- and wear my emotions on my sleeve- Jordan gave me his origami for the day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/t.origami.jpg" alt="Origami" /></p>

<p>He makes these everyday! Out of bus passes and random papers. They are AMAZING. I love them and wish I could make these things without looking them up..</p>

<p>Wednesday Izabella brought Ziggy to class! He was super sweet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/w.ziggy.jpg" alt="Dog" /></p>

<p>It was INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY and during stand up George gave a really, really nice little speech about it. (And I was really glad that I wasn&rsquo;t the first to mention it during interestings!) Anyway, there were a lot of events going on that night- but I couldn&rsquo;t make any of them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/w.iwd.jpg" alt="IWD Event" /></p>

<p>I finally completed a KATA submission on Wednesday, but it won&rsquo;t load. I&rsquo;m guessing that I&rsquo;m missing something-  but i&rsquo;ll have to come back to that later.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/w.codewar.jpg" alt="Codewars" /></p>

<p>Thursday was BEAUTIFUL. I spent my free time outside. For lunch, Zac met me a Briders. They have a baby kale and apple salad he&rsquo;s been raving about- so I had to try it so that we can make it at home! (it was actually fantastic).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/r.lunch.jpg" alt="Zac at Lunch" /></p>

<p>During lecture, we discussed agile workflows and user stories. I was super excited to move into this discussion - because it&rsquo;s such an important aspect of work at Pivotal and I had heard so much about it. Plus, we got to use Pivotal Tracker for logging user stories- it was a cool intersection of Zac&rsquo;s life and my schooling!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/r.agile.png" alt="Agile" /></p>

<p>All afternoon, we working on assessments and brainstormed projects on the balcony. As mentioned, it was BEAUTIFUL!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/r.group.jpg" alt="Outside" /></p>

<p>Friday was PROPOSAL DAY. Oh gosh- FOUR WEEKS DONE? When did that happen&hellip;. Week five is all about our personal project- so on Friday we wrote up proposals- submitting them for review and made revisions as needed. Mine ended up getting approved a couple hours before the end of the day- but I&rsquo;ll save that for next week. What was REALLY exciting about Friday was that IT WAS REXY&rsquo;S FIRST DAY AT GALVANIZE. Here he is being good boy at stand up:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.rexstand.jpg" alt="Rex" /></p>

<p>We had a guest speaker- and he was pretty vocal during that (opps). He just wanted some water&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.rexspeaker.jpg" alt="Rex during speaker" /></p>

<p>After that, we ironically did a agile exercise and it included a lot of tennis balls. Rex was super good though. And the exercise was awesome.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.tennis.jpg" alt="Tennis" /></p>

<p>He pretty much just slept (because let&rsquo;s be honest, I took him for a run before we went in).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.rexsleep.jpg" alt="Sleeping rex" /></p>

<p>We met Zac for lunch, and Rex went home with him after that- so that I could focus on some work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.lunch.jpg" alt="Rex hotdog" /></p>

<p>So- that was week Four. A relatively easy going week to lead into projects. A great step with Rex. Lots of sun and fun. Here&rsquo;s our updated Q1 learn map!:</p>
