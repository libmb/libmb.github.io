<p>Since moving to Denver in July, I have been working hard to learn how to code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/codewars.jpg" alt="codewars" /></p>

<p>Way back in middle school, I ran a website. It was for quotes- which I am sure were not properly cited, but the site was cool, the cursor had a tail, and it was definitely pink. I was self taught. After school, I would come home and sit at the computer for hours trying to figure out how the code worked. How I could pick it apart and put it together. Slowly figuring out how I could get my site to do something new. I loved it. Then, the quote trend passed, and I moved away from that side of learning.</p>

<p>In my first paraprofessional role, I found myself leading programs for kids. One of the first was a program using Scratch. I loved it. I had so much fun with those kids, and they were so creative. I realized that I was still really interested in learning how to code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/scratch1.jpg" alt="scratch" /></p>

<p>Then I interviewed for a new position. The interviewer asked what I wanted to learn for myself in the next year- what were my personal goals? In response, I said I wanted to learn how to code. That I had wanted to, and that it would be a good thing to work on. OF COURSE, I really had no time. I signed up for a few online classes.. but never practiced enough to retain anything I was learning. I even joined the mailing list for Girls Who Code in Syracuse, but never made it to a class.</p>

<p>Back in June, when we decided to make the move to Denver, I was taking Rex for a walk. I found myself once again thinking,</p>

<p><em>I would really love to learn web development. Maybe, in like 10 years, I&rsquo;ll have the time to learn it and it can be a second career&hellip;</em></p>

<p>Then, I realized, why wait? Why wait to learn, what I have already been waiting to learn? So, I got home, and brought it up with Zac. Now, I have an amazingly supportive husband. He was all for it, and he&rsquo;s supported me every step.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskweek.JPG" alt="weekday" />
<img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskwknd.JPG" alt="weekend" /></p>

<p>So, we moved, and almost every day since August, I have been coding. Learning through Codeacademy, Udacity and Codewars. On the weekends, Zac and I will pair up and work on projects together. All along, I have been working to be good enough to apply for a bootcamp. This month, I applied. I interviewed. I was accepted. AND in just over two weeks I will be starting the immersive web development program at Galvanize Platte! I&rsquo;M SO EXCITED.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rexsnout.jpg" alt="scratch" /></p>

<p>I do want to mention right now that I still LOVE library science. It is my goal to combine all of the skills I have with the skills I&rsquo;ll learn.  I have zero regrets when it comes to the decisions I&rsquo;ve made this far.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/macbookpro.png" alt="new computer" /></p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m prepping for the course. It&rsquo;s intensive, so I&rsquo;m trying to prepare myself ahead of time. Adjusting my sleep schedule, hitting the gym early, spending time with meal plans! I&rsquo;m also still learning- and getting use to my new Macbook Pro.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rollingmacs.jpg" alt="pair" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to be challenging, but let&rsquo;s be honest, I love a good challenge. I love learning. I love being busy. And, I&rsquo;m hecka excited. I can hardly wait&hellip;</p>
