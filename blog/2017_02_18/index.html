<p>So this past week was my first at Galvanize, but there was time outside of class! I&rsquo;m going to try to break up my posts between school work, and life outside of class..</p>

<p>This past week Zac was in Portland, so every night we caught up on my day! I think he was as excited as me that I started school.</p>

<p>Monday I came home and just relaxed. All week it was really great that I had easy meals ready to go.</p>

<p>Tuesday was Valentines day! Rex got a treat of course.</p>

<p>After Galvanize, I headed to the gym. A very nice lady decided to talk to me while I was on the elliptical. She was concerned that I was at the gym alone (also the only person in the gym) on Valentines. I explained that Zac was in Portland- but come on- who does that?</p>

<p>After going to the gym and talking to Zac, Rex and I watched some Twilight while working on some CLI Murder Mystery! It was a really fun way to practice command line.</p>

<p>Wednesday my new bag came! I ordered an everyday tote- it is awesome! It has all of these collapsable dividers and is the perfect size. I love it!</p>

<p>After the CodePen Meetup, I headed to the gym at Galvanize. It was totally empty, and it was nice to change up the scenery.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/ggym.jpg" alt="Gym" /></p>

<p>Thursday night Zac got home from Portland (and will be home for three weeks at least!!). I immediately had him run through a Git/Github exercise to explain some concepts for me. He&rsquo;s a sweet guy..</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/zacgit.jpg" alt="git hub" /></p>

<p>All week I stopped home for Rex at lunch. All week he would watch me eat before heading to the dog park. He pretty much moped- I think he misses all our fun weekday adventures- but we&rsquo;ll make it up on the weekends.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/lunchrex.jpg" alt="Rexy" /></p>

<p>The meal planning/prepping was lifesaving. It was the only reason I had time this week! AND, this week I had grapefruit as M2. I realized it has been 10 years since I had a grapefruit, and I LOVE THEM. So, I need to eat those more.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/grapefruit.jpg" alt="Grapefruit" /></p>

<p>It was a really great week. The weather was nice, and it felt good to be busy!</p>
