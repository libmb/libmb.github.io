&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we cleaned up around the house- then headed to the airport to meet Steph &amp;amp; Geoff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/airport.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sign&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Steph brought supplies to restock our Wegmans necessities! &lt;em&gt;the best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/wegmans.png&#34; alt=&#34;Food&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were so excited to have guests, and there were so many places we wanted to take them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening we headed over to Galvanize, so I could show all three around my new school. Zac and Geoff squeezed in a game of ping pong, met an instructor and one of my cohort peers who was getting some work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gschool.png&#34; alt=&#34;Galvanize&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we headed over to McLoughlins for a drink before going to Zengo for dinner with Zac and Stephs cousin, Danielle and her boyfriend Tim. After, we were still a little hungry, so we walked up to Littleman for some ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/littleman.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;little man&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday we went to Eldora for a day of skiing/snowboarding. It was a pretty nice day, we were actually really warm but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to trek back to the car to ditch our jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/eldora.png&#34; alt=&#34;skiing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night we headed out. First we stopped at Avanti for drinks and food. Then we went all the way to Larimer where we got a drink. We stopped by Rocket Fizz for some fun/candy and then headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/avanti_lar.png&#34; alt=&#34;avanti and larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday we went to the Botanic Gardens. It was SCFD Free day! It was free, and I am obsessed with the Gardens so it was a no brainer. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s winter, and so everything is dead. It was a little lackluster but the rainforest was still pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gardens.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;botanic gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we drove out to Boulder to do some walking along Pearl St. It was cold in the wind, but the sun was nice. We stopped for food and had the worst service.. but overall it was a nice day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday night we headed to the hockey game!!!! And when we got there, it was empty! Ha, Zac had purchased tickets for a Tuesday game, thinking it was Monday. Instead we just walked over to PublicSchool303 for drinks and dinner. An old friend was in town, so she stopped by too and it was nice to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/nothockey.png&#34; alt=&#34;not hockey&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday while I was in class, everyone went up to Red Rocks to explore. After class, I met everyone at Denver Beer Co, and we headed to the ACTUAL hockey game! The Avalanche are literally the worst team in the NHL, but sports are fun so it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/hockey.png&#34; alt=&#34;hockey&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning Steph joined me at the gym!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym buddy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night Zac had gotten Steph and Geoff a hotel in Cherry Creek so they could have a night of vacation together! We went grocery shopping and did laundry&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday while I was in class, the group went to a brewery and an arcade. After, we went to Bones for dinner. It was a great meal, and the restaurant is nice and intimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/bones.png&#34; alt=&#34;bones dinner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was our LAST DAY. While I was in class Zac, Steph and Geoff headed to Keystone for some AWESOME skiing/snowboarding and I&amp;rsquo;m jealous! I would have loved to go, but i&amp;rsquo;ll get to next time. When I got home from school everyone was really tired and apparently the altitude was putting some stress on them. Zac stayed home while the three of us went down the road to My Brothers Bar for some dinner. It was ok.. but we were really hungry so it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, before leaving, we went and grabbed brunch at Carbon. We will miss them so much, but it was a GREAT week and we can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/carbon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carbon brunch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short week! Monday we were off for Presidents day! Tuesday we started off covering test based assessments. Right now, we are using them for some of our assessments- but I look forward to Q2 when we learn how to write them! Now we have an updated flow/map of Q1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/flow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flow chart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spent some more time on Responsive CSS. I will say that by the end of this week, I feel much better about the topic and like flex box a lot more. I also really respect mobile first design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/css.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;css&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early this week I realized that I had some fierce competition on CodeWars. Its healthy, but is making me try harder katas and i&amp;rsquo;m trying to fit more in. One morning I worked on one for like three hours, and when I went to submit it I got a server error. No worries, I had it copied. It was funny.. (and I&amp;rsquo;m still losing)..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/codewars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;codewars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we started JavaScript. I was super excited to switch it up and start another aspect of web dev. We covered the basics and did some assessments. During free time I headed upstairs to work from the &amp;lsquo;club galvanize&amp;rsquo; area. Stevie was in the classroom outside and I just love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/stevie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday after class, Galvanize had a guest speaker, the CTO at Rachio. I stayed to hear from him- about his company and the work they do (although, I have a friend who works there so I was already pretty familiar). It was really cool to see how involved their system is! If I had a yard I&amp;rsquo;d totally look into their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we learned DOM. I was not feeling well and it was really hard for me to process anything we learned. I took some medicine while on lunch and felt much better in the afternoon. I feel like I am getting better- but I still need to do some work to understand the basic concepts. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably dedicate some time to that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/domfiddle.png&#34; alt=&#34;js fiddle screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way to class Friday I stopped for a latte. Because friday. and latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/ink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ink coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning we had another guest speaker. This time it was Michael Dusing, a local UX Designer. He had a GREAT presentation about work, life and paths to success. I loved hearing from him, his slideshow was FANTASTIC and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hear from more design people. He also brought stickers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/guest.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Guest Speaker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we started another scrimmage day, while one-on-ones were going on. This week we worked on a pixel art creator. I got stuck a few places, and loved working with my table. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with what I accomplished in one day- but have some stretch goals I want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/pixel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel Art&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this past week was my first at Galvanize, but there was time outside of class! I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to break up my posts between school work, and life outside of class..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week Zac was in Portland, so every night we caught up on my day! I think he was as excited as me that I started school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday I came home and just relaxed. All week it was really great that I had easy meals ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/mondinner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dinner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was Valentines day! Rex got a treat of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/rexvday.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Valentines&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Galvanize, I headed to the gym. A very nice lady decided to talk to me while I was on the elliptical. She was concerned that I was at the gym alone (also the only person in the gym) on Valentines. I explained that Zac was in Portland- but come on- who does that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/vdaygym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going to the gym and talking to Zac, Rex and I watched some Twilight while working on some CLI Murder Mystery! It was a really fun way to practice command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/vdayfun.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CLI&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday my new bag came! I ordered an everyday tote- it is awesome! It has all of these collapsable dividers and is the perfect size. I love it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/bag.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Peak Design Everyday Tote&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the CodePen Meetup, I headed to the gym at Galvanize. It was totally empty, and it was nice to change up the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday night Zac got home from Portland (and will be home for three weeks at least!!). I immediately had him run through a Git/Github exercise to explain some concepts for me. He&amp;rsquo;s a sweet guy..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/zacgit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;git hub&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All week I stopped home for Rex at lunch. All week he would watch me eat before heading to the dog park. He pretty much moped- I think he misses all our fun weekday adventures- but we&amp;rsquo;ll make it up on the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/lunchrex.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rexy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meal planning/prepping was lifesaving. It was the only reason I had time this week! AND, this week I had grapefruit as M2. I realized it has been 10 years since I had a grapefruit, and I LOVE THEM. So, I need to eat those more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/lunch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;prepped lunch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/grapefruit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grapefruit&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really great week. The weather was nice, and it felt good to be busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_18/weather.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;weather&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEEK ONE GALVANIZE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/firstdayofschoolpic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture First Day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day one, we played the name game &lt;em&gt;Mighty Michelle&lt;/em&gt; and met instructors, administrators, etc! Our first lesson was on &amp;lsquo;How to learn.&amp;rsquo; They served us a great lunch- wraps from protein bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/lunch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Protein Bar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs were super sore from runday on Sunday, and standing through the name game killed me! So, I sat on the ground. Nothing like a first impression-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/soreleg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ground sitting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we got another tour, received our key fobs and talked about the Galvanize Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/dayone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;White board&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to meet so many dogs! Kiki, as previously mentioned, is our class dog. Well- she is our residents dog so she&amp;rsquo;ll be hanging with us most days. The other two dogs belong to other instructors. Gosh I love being surrounded by them all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/dogs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dogs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After class on Monday, Galvanize organized a happy hour on the fourth floor to welcome us in. Everyone was invited (students, instructors, members).. and it was a pretty busy event! It was nice to meet some other people in the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/happyhour.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Happy Hour&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday our first lesson was on POLYA- or how to solve problems. The day started with a warm up logic puzzle. My group didn&amp;rsquo;t do so great- apparently it relied on a lot of math and that is not my strong suit! Things to work on&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we learned some command line and VIM. We had three assessments to work on- and things were officially getting started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/polya.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we started with another logic puzzle. This time my group nailed it. I still need to practice though. I think i&amp;rsquo;ll grab a book next time i&amp;rsquo;m out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons on Wednesday were Git, Github and HTML. My table and I got into a serious discussion trying to figure out branching- hence our great use of the whiteboard table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/branching.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Branch Pictures&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did the same when trying to conceptualize the process of setting remote vs. upstream with Git&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/upstream.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Upstream diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night there was a meetup at Galvanize for CodePen. I headed home to take care of Rex and grab some (PREPPED) dinner before going back. It was a really cool showcase of things people had made- how they made them, and why. At one point, a nine year old girl got up with her dad to show off her html/css project. I just about died- and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I can apply to work for her in 6 months (exaggerating, but, not by much- she might rule the world someday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/codepengroup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meetup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we started responsive CSS. I pretty much got into fights with flex box all day. Luckily I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone- and many of us found great tutorials and tools to help learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we admire Kiki in her natural state? She is SO CUTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/kiki.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sleeping kiki&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also introduced to a concept called courage time. Pretty much we dedicate one hour to learning something we don&amp;rsquo;t know. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to have mastery in the topic- or even a fluency, but the point is that in one hour you can learn a lot- and accomplish a lot, in a topic you previously knew nothing about. I look forward to using courage time to delve into topics we might not cover in class (like design!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday- the final day of module one, week one! In the morning we had a guest speaker. She was a previous student who talked about her time, and what she is doing now! Then it was scrimmage day! Through the day, the instructors met with all the students for one-on-one meetings. While not in a meeting- we were working on our own site (using the skills we covered this week). I worked on a personal site. At 3, as usual, the keg was tapped- but they also had wine on tap! I grabbed a glass- and got my Galvanize swag! It was a great way to end the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/wine.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wine&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/swag.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;swag&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All week I packed my bag with Larabars as M4. It was the first time I tried them, and I absolutely LOVE cookie dough. The other flavors are really good too! They&amp;rsquo;ll probably become a regular thing for me..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last free weekend before Galvanize was wonderful! Thursday evening I headed over to Galvanize for an informal get together- saying HI before starting on Monday. I met Kiki, our class dog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/kiki.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kiki the dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday night we headed out to Avanti for dinner. It was a gorgeous night, and we stopped by Prost first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/prost.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Beer and City&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so nice to sit outside and chat about life. Then we headed to Avanti, we sat downstairs, ordered some pizza for National pizza day, and went up to the roof for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/avanti.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Avanti&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I spent a bunch of time sitting outside with Rex. It was really nice out, and that way Zac has some privacy during his work calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/outside.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Patio view&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent hours meal planning for the entire first module of Galvanize ( !4 weeks worth! )- The module is five weeks long, but we will have company the first week so it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to plan a bunch of meals when we&amp;rsquo;ll probably play the week by ear. Anyways, I was super impressed with my work. 4 weeks worth of 5 tone it up meals a day, complete with shopping lists and meal prep schedules. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/mealplan.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Computer screen&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday we went out for dinner again. Monday starts the tone it up seven day slim down- I hadn&amp;rsquo;t grabbed groceries yet- so it was a good opportunity to get out again. ALSO it was high 70s and we wanted to enjoy a patio! We went to Larimer and stopped at a wine bar. We did two wine tastings and enjoyed some appetizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/larzac.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Zac at Larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/larimer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home we stopped for coffee. Because love for coffee &amp;gt; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t drink coffee at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/amante.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Amante Coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we relaxed all day- caught up on some house stuff. Sunday morning I headed out for my hair appointment. Since moving to Denver i&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Clementines in the highlands. On Sunday they opened a new location in Stapleton, and my hairdresser will be working there from now on! I decided to go there- to keep her, and check out the new place. It was really nice, I ended up being the first customer at the new location on opening day. It&amp;rsquo;s located at Stanley Marketplace, this awesome old airplane hangar that has been converted to shops and restaurants/breweries. There was a crossfit place that looked awesome too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/clementines.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Clementines&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way out, I grabbed two lattes from Logan&amp;rsquo;s Coffee House. They were great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/logans.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday evening was meal plan time! I threw on the 90s playlist from Spotify, and got to work. Throughout I was snapping the process. I know that I snapped more to my story that day than I have ever before, combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/mealprep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;meal preping&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;shoes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt so good afterwards! 5 days of quality meals. As for fitness, my new shoes came in this week- and I had some really great workouts. It was nice to have Zac home all week again. It&amp;rsquo;s always great to have a gym buddy. We did some biking together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/bike.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A busy relaxing week</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been so gorgeous here lately, that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that a week ago everything was covered in ice! We had a nice day, and right as the sun was setting, starting getting some drizzle. Well, it all turned to ice and our walk that night and the next morning was treacherous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/cold.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ice outside&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am officially in the last week of the January 2017 Tone It Up Challenge! I&amp;rsquo;m loving it, and I plan to keep it up afterwards. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really sore this past week, but a good sore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/tiu.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fitness challenge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jumped on the bike this week, to change up my cardio routine. I need to get some practice in before summer! I want to be in shape so I can keep up with my new biking friends (and, as always, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep up with my husband). Personally, I still think assisted downhill is the. way. to. go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/bike.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;indoor bike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we headed to Eldora! It was a gorgeous day- the snow was amazing. I just love it! We took ZERO indoor breaks on Saturday. The best part was eating lunch on my favorite run. We&amp;rsquo;re still working our way through my last batch of chili. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to make more before Steph and Geoff come it visit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/eldoracol.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;eldora lunch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/eldoraz.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;zac at Eldora&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got home in the afternoon, the sun was still up and it was 60 degrees! We took the pup downtown, and stopped at Panera to grab some bread for the week. They were out of our favorite loaf, so we decided to try some Asiago. It was good, but, the other is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/panera.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;panera&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday night we watched Man in the High Castle, and enjoyed some wine and cheese. On that note, we actually caught up this week. We have so many questions! It&amp;rsquo;s such a good show, and the characters are great, but some things just don&amp;rsquo;t make sense! I guess that&amp;rsquo;s how they get you to keep watching&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/cheese.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rex begging&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday we decided to take Rex on an adventure. We had been gone most of Saturday, and we wanted to give him a chance to get out some energy! I looked at some of the hikes I had highlighted last year, and decided to head to Mt. Falcon. It&amp;rsquo;s only 30 minutes away, and it claimed to have awesome views of red rocks and Denver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/mtfalconz2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Take a Hike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a gorgeous day, and for the first half of our hike, we were actually pretty warm. Then, on the way back, we hit the dark side of the trails, and found ourselves trudging through snow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/sunsnow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mt Falcon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hike was as described, and had awesome views to take in. There was a lookout tower you could climb up, and this awesome little pavilion that is set right on the edge. I told Zac, it gave me serious window view goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/falconviews.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Views from Mt Falcon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our first hike of 2017. Rex had the BEST. DAY. EVER. And we had a great time too. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get back out more often. It&amp;rsquo;s really rejuvenating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/mtfalconm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me at Mt Falcon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/mtfalconz.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sign&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday I had to run some errands, and got caught in a massive slow down on the 25. It was like a parking lot. I have no patience for slow traffic, and driving standard makes it worse. I was pretty much done when I got home, so I went straight to the gym to take out my frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/parkinglot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Slow down on 25&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday night we went out for groceries, but I forgot my reusable shopping bags. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, Ikea bags will do in a pinch- haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/ikea.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Groceries&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been filled in with working on precourse work for Galvanize. I CANT wait to start on Monday. I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to go in later this week to meet instructors and jazz. I finished most of the assignments, and set up all my accounts, so it feels real!  AND late last week I got awesome news, that I received a scholarship! It pretty much made my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/gschool.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gSchool&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I got the itch to re-arrange our furniture. I knew that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it now, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have time! SO- while Zac was busy working, I set to moving all our belongings around him. He usually hates it when I move things- it gives him anxiety until it&amp;rsquo;s finished. However, he was a total champ. I&amp;rsquo;ll post a picture of the new layout next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/move.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Furniture moving&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is, I have a few more goals before Monday. 1. Make chili 2. Meal plan like CRAZY (5 weeks worth?) 3. Keep up with my daily reading goals- because I so want to finish this Epic Fantasy within my month goal and 4. SIT IN THE SUN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_08/sunshine.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sun&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>659 Square Feet</title>
          <link>https://libmb.github.io/post/2017_02_05/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:00:00 &#43;0900</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://libmb.github.io/post/2017_02_05/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in July we moved out of our house in NY. It was a 1,452 sqft house (not including the full finished basement, or the bonus room above the garage). We moved from a house with four bedrooms, and two bathrooms to a one bed, one bath apartment. A mere 659 sqft. Here, my friends, is how we make it work..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/title.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FULL DISCLOSURE: We also have a storage unit. It&amp;rsquo;s small, and contains our spare tires, tool box and bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VERY first thing we did was DOWNSIZE. That deserves a post all of its own.. so I won&amp;rsquo;t go too much into that. Suffice to say that we got rid of SO MUCH STUFF. Things we didn&amp;rsquo;t use nor need&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting up our apartment, the first thing I focused on was creating areas. Identifying what we needed from the space, and setting it up accordingly. We would need a living area, a place for Zac to work from home, an area to eat, and of course areas to cook and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/Zones-01.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our furniture came with us. This table by the door was a wedding gift. It&amp;rsquo;s not a zone of its own, but it serves a definite purpose near the door. The drawer currently has gloves and hats in it. The metal container holds all of our dog food, and there is a bin for shoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/foyer.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would need a living area- a place to sit and relax! Watch TV.. cuddle the dog. You know. Living room.
(Oh and our couch doubles as a pull out bed!- Necessary for guests)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/living space.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really important aspect of our living space is a  work area. Zac works from home on occasion- and I have been using the office zone when Zac is on travel to 1. blog and 2. learn to code! Now that I&amp;rsquo;ll be getting back to school, I&amp;rsquo;ll need it even more. The only downside to the current layout is that sometimes Zac has video calls. However, we solved the issue of seeing into the kitchen- he just puts the desk in &amp;lsquo;stand&amp;rsquo; mode, and you can&amp;rsquo;t see anything but the Besta unit behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/office.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our &amp;lsquo;dining&amp;rsquo; area, we have two stools at the counter! There is just enough of  a ledge to make it work. Since it&amp;rsquo;s just the two of us, this is totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/dining.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/dining2.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen, bathroom and bedroom zones are pre-made by the apartment layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/kitchen.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we needed to FIND AND MAKE STORAGE. Even after getting rid of the majority of our items, I knew the key to success in a small space would be storage. When we moved, we took a trip to Ikea and we targeted items that would give us extra space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/storage-01.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought a TV stand that has two compartments. We store our blankets, movies, XBox controllers, and the surge protector in the closed areas. In addition, the box on the shelf holds all my greeting card materials! (Because, STORAGE EVERYWHERE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/tvstand-01.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the BEST purchases was our BESTA unit. It&amp;rsquo;s so slick, minimal and modern looking when it&amp;rsquo;s closed up. Inside, ALL THE THINGS BELONG. It is still a work in progress..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/Storage.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use bins and boxes to store items too. Our bookshelf is full of storage opportunities. In addition to what you can see here, some shelves have double book rows or hidden boxes behind the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/bookshelf-01.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bedframe has two huge drawers underneath- these are full of blankets and sheets (the other side has no drawers, but my wedding dress). We brought our file cabinet from NY, and now it&amp;rsquo;s my end table. Does the job, saves some space! After we had everything set up, we realized that Rex&amp;rsquo;s bed was way too big. I measured the space by the bed, behind the closet door and was able to find a bed that would fit perfect. Trust me, he has enough room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/bedstore.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out unit has a wonderful little closet with stacked washer/dryer combo! I am able to store our broom, mop and ironing board on the wall with a hanging system. You can&amp;rsquo;t see them in the picture below, but they are on the right-side wall. The vacuum fits right in front (perfectly placed since we use it so much! Rexy&amp;rsquo;s light hair + dark wood floors-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/washer.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little searching, I was able to find a great rolling cart that fit right into the space between washer and wall. It holds all our cleaning supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/cleaning.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing all these spaces is incredibly important- and that is still a big work in progress! Every month I select a small area to completely organize. I take the measurements, and head to my FAVORITE PLACE&amp;hellip; The Container Store. I come home and organize away. It makes my heart happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/organize-01.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways I think about organization. 1. How often is the item used and 2. Where is the item used. If something is used everyday, it&amp;rsquo;s readily available (like my Ninja blender that I use at least once a day. It&amp;rsquo;s on the kitchen counter). If it&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s used once a week to once a month it&amp;rsquo;s stored but accessible (like my toaster. It&amp;rsquo;s in a cabinet). I try to store these things relative to where they are needed. The shelf of the Besta unit that contains office supplies is the one right next to the desk. Our hats and gloves are in a drawer by the door. If you have to travel out of your way to put something away, it might not make it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also purchased two gift boxes to organize cords. One near our computer area, and one under the router on the foyer table. These are fantastic. They were cheap, but are really sturdy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/cords.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/router.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that is how we make it work. It would be nice to have an extra room as an office- and as a place for guests to sleep. We&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting our firsts guests this month! Time will tell us how the pull out couch, and lack of dining table affects the visit. We have two good things going for us: 1. the complex we live in is really nice, and there are other places we can go to sit/eat/whatever 2. we live in Denver, so there&amp;rsquo;s really no reason to ever be cooped up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/smell.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I leave you with two tips for first floor living: 1. white noise maker 2. window film. The noise maker is wonderful because we have a very protective dog. He likes to freak out if he hears anyone walking by, so we have it on near the window while we sleep. The window film is awesome for privacy. We bought it really cheap on Amazon, cut it to fit the bottom of our window. Now we can slide the blinds up and get lots of natural light without being seen by anyone walking by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_05/livelong.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;--&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly love our apartment&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s just big enough to stretch out. I like our layout- I can see the TV while in the kitchen, or at the computer. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s been an adjustment, but a welcome one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALSO, HEY, I CAN VACUUM THE ENTIRE PLACE WITHOUT UNPLUGGING THE VACUUM! WHAT!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Friday night we went out for Thai! As usual, Zac ordered the better dish. Mine was a little (way) too spicy for my likes, so I helped Z out a bit. It was good, but we&amp;rsquo;ll still be on the hunt for Denvers best Thai!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/thai.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dinner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday night we went out for a few drinks. We wanted to stay close, since Zac was still recovering. We headed to Zengo, but they had a huge Year of the Rooster celebration going on, and we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get in the door! So we went next door to McLoughlins. It was probably for the better. They were playing great 90s music and had the X Games on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/drinks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;drinks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Open was on at 1 am, so we (Zac) were determined to stay up for it! Rafa and Fed? It was sure to be a great match, and from what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, it was! I fell asleep as soon as it started. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t stay up another minute! Zac was a champ and watched the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/aus.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tennis&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday Zac was super tired from his late night so we pretty much just hung out and watched The Man at the High Castle. I went to the gym, of course. The workouts are still great, and this week they&amp;rsquo;re amping them up a little. It&amp;rsquo;s great timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/fitness.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made omelettes for breakfast with the veggies I had left over from the week. We also tried the Ginger Sesame Chicken from TIU and it was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/food.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;food&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday I took Rex on some errands. During the weeks while Zac is gone I try to take Rex everywhere. It helps keep his energy down! Monday I rewarded him with a quick stop at Krisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/errands.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Amazon order came in Monday afternoon. Two more of the BEST sports bras, and a new container of ACV. I spent the afternoon meal prepping. I made Almond Butter cookies for the cookie smoothie on the plan this week. Its delicious! I also made some Cinnamon Energy Bites to take to craft night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/drink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;drinks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving for the evening, I took Rex for a nice long walk. We got some really good views of the sunset. I do wish I could grab a photo that does the mountains justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/sunset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunset&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday I grabbed a lyft to Cojos for Craft Night! I missed the last few months due to holiday travel, and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited I finally made it. Ladies, wine, food, crafts. What else could you want in an evening? I even managed to organize someones prismacolor pencils. Because, personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALSO BTW. Lyft/Uber rides are my favorite thing since moving to Denver. Really. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll give a little rave for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/craft.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;craft&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I cleaned up and took a bunch of photos for my next blog post. I also caught up on The Vampire Diaries. Zac&amp;rsquo;s sister, Mel, and I are the hugest TVD Fans. This week when NINA posted that she&amp;rsquo;d be coming back- we pretty much freaked out. I AM SO EXCITED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_01/tvd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tvd&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have some precourse work to start for gSchool&amp;hellip;!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Rex and I had some movie dates. We watched The Secret Life of Pets (adorable) and The Legend of Tarzan (amazing). I even let him on the couch, because I. Am. Weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/secretlife.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;movie&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few beautiful days, so we went on long walks in the highlands and lodo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/highlands.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;highlands&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/lodo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lodo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac got home last Thursday night, and he has been sick with an awful cold since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/siczac.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;zac&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, this weekend, Rex got some form of conjunctivitis. So, with a ton of medicine and as much patience as possible, I have been caring for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/sick.png&#34; alt=&#34;zac and rex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rogue order came in on Friday! It has been so helpful! The sklz slidez are great- I kept falling off my other ones. These have grooves which allow greater movement without losing your place! The ab mat is fantastic, and I grabbed the shirt for Zac (it fits with his general philosophy and when I saw it I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass it ups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/fitness.png&#34; alt=&#34;rogue&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I made moroccan stew. It&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite dish, but I&amp;rsquo;m also not use to sweet tasting soups. I LOVED Chia seed pudding. A great way to satisfy a sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/food.png&#34; alt=&#34;food&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have had an addiction to Lattes. Seriously, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed. I don&amp;rsquo;t even like the taste of coffee any more- I am totally ruined. We have two great places within walking distance: Ink &amp;amp; Carbon. At Ink, I love the white almond latte. At Carbon, I always switch it up. They make their own syrups, and I always love what I get. This week I grabbed a lemon verbena and it was amazing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching options for making them at home&amp;hellip; but no clear solution yet. &lt;em&gt;sighs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/latte.png&#34; alt=&#34;latte&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday, was football day. UGH. What an anxiety filled game. Rex settled his head right on our legs, probably trying to ground us. It was a night full of cuss words and &amp;ldquo;Oh Man&amp;rdquo; texts to my brother. I went to bed totally heartbroken. I still love my team, and I look forward to seeing them next season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/steelers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;steelers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting up early has been harder this week&amp;hellip; but when I manage to get myself up and moving, I am greeted by a wonderful sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_27/sunrise.png&#34; alt=&#34;morning&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend will probably be low-key, but next week Zac will be in LA, and I have some fun things planned to pass the time. Two weeks until school!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving to Denver in July, I have been working hard to learn how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/codewars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;codewars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way back in middle school, I ran a website. It was for quotes- which I am sure were not properly cited, but the site was cool, the cursor had a tail, and it was definitely pink. I was self taught. After school, I would come home and sit at the computer for hours trying to figure out how the code worked. How I could pick it apart and put it together. Slowly figuring out how I could get my site to do something new. I loved it. Then, the quote trend passed, and I moved away from that side of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first paraprofessional role, I found myself leading programs for kids. One of the first was a program using Scratch. I loved it. I had so much fun with those kids, and they were so creative. I realized that I was still really interested in learning how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/scratch1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scratch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I interviewed for a new position. The interviewer asked what I wanted to learn for myself in the next year- what were my personal goals? In response, I said I wanted to learn how to code. That I had wanted to, and that it would be a good thing to work on. OF COURSE, I really had no time. I signed up for a few online classes.. but never practiced enough to retain anything I was learning. I even joined the mailing list for Girls Who Code in Syracuse, but never made it to a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June, when we decided to make the move to Denver, I was taking Rex for a walk. I found myself once again thinking,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would really love to learn web development. Maybe, in like 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ll have the time to learn it and it can be a second career&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I realized, why wait? Why wait to learn, what I have already been waiting to learn? So, I got home, and brought it up with Zac. Now, I have an amazingly supportive husband. He was all for it, and he&amp;rsquo;s supported me every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskweek.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;weekday&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskwknd.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;weekend&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we moved, and almost every day since August, I have been coding. Learning through Codeacademy, Udacity and Codewars. On the weekends, Zac and I will pair up and work on projects together. All along, I have been working to be good enough to apply for a bootcamp. This month, I applied. I interviewed. I was accepted. AND in just over two weeks I will be starting the immersive web development program at Galvanize Platte! I&amp;rsquo;M SO EXCITED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rexsnout.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scratch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention right now that I still LOVE library science. It is my goal to combine all of the skills I have with the skills I&amp;rsquo;ll learn.  I have zero regrets when it comes to the decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made this far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/macbookpro.png&#34; alt=&#34;new computer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m prepping for the course. It&amp;rsquo;s intensive, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to prepare myself ahead of time. Adjusting my sleep schedule, hitting the gym early, spending time with meal plans! I&amp;rsquo;m also still learning- and getting use to my new Macbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rollingmacs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pair&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s going to be challenging, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, I love a good challenge. I love learning. I love being busy. And, I&amp;rsquo;m hecka excited. I can hardly wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes 21 days to make a habit, and I&amp;rsquo;m on day 19 of Tone It Up! That&amp;rsquo;s 2 days from a habit? AND 2 days since &amp;ldquo;Ditch Day&amp;rdquo;. This week I&amp;rsquo;m feeling great again. Last week I had some ups and downs-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_spotify.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;playlist&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, helpful tool of the week: CARDIO PLAYLIST ON SPOTIFY.
Seriously love this list so much. After I finished my last audiobook, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into the next one I picked. I was only a few days away from a new Audible credit, so I decided to wait it out and listen to some music (&amp;amp; catch some TV like NFL GAME DAY and a movie here or there). I have my new credit, and love my new book- but I only listen to it during cardio. Ironically, the rest of the time, I&amp;rsquo;m moving to the Cardio Playlist! If you&amp;rsquo;re into high octane music, give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_tv.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tv&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned last week is that I NEED TO EAT. I was so busy- I was jumping from one thing to the next and not prioritizing all 5 meals. So, I&amp;rsquo;d skip one, or two, in a day. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel hungry, until bed time. At that point, I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to eat anything. I&amp;rsquo;m trying REALLY hard not to eat anything after 7pm. So, I went to bed hungry. This was a HUGE MISTAKE. With the workouts, cardio and yoga I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing- I need food! Power! Energy! (Also, everyone needs food, and you should never go to bed hungry). I ended up crashing last week- and took some long naps. Then I started keeping up with meals. Even if I had to combine a M2 and M3, or a M4 and M5. I ate all the food in the plan. And you know what- I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to bed hungry, and I have so much energy. So, EAT! It&amp;rsquo;s part of taking care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_food.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;food&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating aside, I also somehow hurt my leg this past weekend. Just a strained muscle- but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to move it into an injury- so while I&amp;rsquo;ve kept up on all workouts, I have been going just a little bit easier on my cardio (little less resistance, a few less strides/minute). It already feels better and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll kick cardio back up a notch in a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gym window&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for workouts, I never purchased the workout videos from Tone It Up. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating my own circuits. The ability to create these, well, I give all of the credit to Crossfit! Oh- a 22 minute video doing legs and shoulders? I&amp;rsquo;ll throw together an EMOM. Or a METCON. Or, my absolute fav, Fight Gone Bad Style. Today there was an Arms and Abs video I don&amp;rsquo;t have- so I threw together this FGB style workout: crunches, plank, sit ups, push ups, arm circles, break, dumbbell side bend, med ball chopper, farm carry, balance point crunches, break. The flow feels really productive- and you can do anything for 1 minute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_FGB.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;workout&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Crossfit- I do miss it. I miss it most on days when the plan calls for something like deadlifts, and I&amp;rsquo;m like- where my Olympic Weights at? Haha. I can only do so much with 12 lb dumbbells&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a little time off from Yoga this week- due to my leg, but I did make one great class on a sunny morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_yoga.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;yoga&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Zac gets home- and he&amp;rsquo;s off travel next week. I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to have my work out partner back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_bud.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Zac&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midway through week 4, I love the plan. My water intake is 100% and my eating is great. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_19/2017_01_19_day.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s only been 9 days since my last post, and I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 9 days! After a slow start to last week, the second half and weekend flew by! I think this post will be a long one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_indy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog cuddles&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(How great is that sweatshirt thought? It&amp;rsquo;s IndyBrand and I want ALL THE THINGS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday morning Zac was off to LA for work! Rex and I went for a great walk. The sun was out, and after I felt pretty engergized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_riverfront.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;walk riverfront&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I finished up some work on the computer. That night, Shadow hunters aired and I was SO excited about it. So, after yoga, Rex and I settled in for a great show. About half way through Zac called, and I was whispering. He asked what was wrong- Oh, nothing, just in the middle of a show- ya know? Haha but it was practically over so we still caught up on his first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was GORGEOUS! I woke up and went to Yoga with one of my favorite teachers. After, I grabbed a lavender honey latte at Carbon Beverage. It was SO GOOD. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get anything to eat, but look at the picture- I will NEED to go back and get a huge cinnamon bun someday (with Zac, to help).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_carbon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carbon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex and I sat in the sun on our patio. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect area- you&amp;rsquo;re totally blocked from the wind, but have full sun access! I was hot sitting in my tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_out1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunny day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_out2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunny day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I woke up and decided to run some errands. We had some gift cards from Christmas- and that is my favorite way to shop! First I headed to Barnes and Noble- where I perused the shelves, tables, and displays before buying the two books I knew I was going to buy (but, as always, I was tempted). I also added a bunch of books to my Goodreads to-read section. Sighs. I bought the Handmaid&amp;rsquo;s Tale, which I don&amp;rsquo;t own and need to re-read, and Bridget Jones&amp;rsquo;s Diary- which I have never read! Honest: I have high expectations there. We&amp;rsquo;ll see when I get around to them. All my library holds came in at the same time, so prioritizing is an issue-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop was literally right next door, Pier One. I use to buy wine glasses there EVERY YEAR. Seriously, they have these beautiful huge goblet like glasses (but more regular size than toyish)&amp;hellip; with the perfect thin glass lip. Every year I would break at least 2, and replace them after Christmas. Until last year, when I bought a bunch of stainless steel (not as great, but still pretty great with the added bonus of not breaking into my disposal).  So this year, I found a soft fluffy pillow and a candle. Trying to be minimal means that I look for things that don&amp;rsquo;t take up too much space, and are functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_shopping.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;shopping&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was in the area- I also stopped at Ikea. I needed some food storage containers, and you can&amp;rsquo;t beat their prices. I also stumbled upon a blanket/pillow cover display and got a few things to change up what I had on the couch (going along with the Pier 1 pillow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_couch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;couch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in the afternoon- I hit a wall. Just totally completely exhausted! I took a really long nap with my new pillow and blanket. So that was great. It was also still really nice out- so for the third day in a row, I was able to open the windows and get some fresh air in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_window.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night I went to an info session at Turing. (AND I HAVE SO MUCH NEWS FOR THAT WORLD- but that&amp;rsquo;ll come in a later post). For now, just know that I got to wear my new shoes that I got for Christmas! Zac&amp;rsquo;s sister gave them to me and I love them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Zac got home on Thursday night I headed to Happy Hour at Avanti&amp;rsquo;s with a friend. She invited a huge group, and everyone brought more people. There ended up being like 20-25 of us, and everyone was really great. Before, every time we went to Avanti, I would look at the bar area thinking &amp;lsquo;I need to get here some night&amp;rsquo;, and it was definitely what I expected. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to take Zac there some time for drinks- and to introduce him to some of the people I met that night!  When Zac got on the train, I walked the two blocks home. I was so busy talking, I got NO pictures. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I got the most unexpected and perfectly timed box ever. My dear friend, who I admire and am so lucky to know, sent me a holiday/care package. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking a lot about life. Actually, we always do, and always will. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to know her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_gift1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_gift2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac was back from LA, so in the morning we took Rex for a walk and grabbed coffee at ink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ink&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I watched a couple episodes of Lemony Snicket- while doing some work. After Zac got off work- we FINALLY went and saw Rogue One! IT WAS GREAT. We had tried to go for weeks, but the AMC Flatiron was totally sold out. I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for the lay down movie theater, so we kept waiting. We loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we went for a long walk. It was nice outside, but not great. We walked to a few different areas we hadn&amp;rsquo;t explored yet, so that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, we had tickets to the Mammoth game! We use to love going to lax games in Buffalo, and were pretty excited to have a team here in Denver. First we stopped for drinks and apps at a place called Public School 303. It was adorable! Decorated for school- they have flash cards on the walls, and menus that look like composition notebooks. Plus, the food and drinks (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; liter of wine on happy hour!) were fantastic. The wings reminded me a place my brother and I went as kids- they had the BEST wings, so that&amp;rsquo;s a high compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ps303.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;public school&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ps3032.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;public school&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we walked to the game and had so much fun! I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go again. It was a really close game too- we won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_pc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pepsi center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_lax.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mammoth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was FOOTBALL DAY. The games were CRAZY! I am stoked that the Steelers won, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to cheer them on this weekend (and every other day, GO STEELERS!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_dog_nap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the weekend was filled in with dog cuddles, walks, and trips to the gym. We also started watching The Man at High Castle, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a great show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll wrap up.. I have a delicious smelling coconut lemon curry to go eat. Exciting news coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_lcsoup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;soup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a week since I started Tone It Up! I&amp;rsquo;ve used the nutrition plan for Fit Girls a few times the past couple years, and while I loved the food, I started to get sick of the same recipes. It was time to switch things up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;m loving the meals- and the daily workouts are definitely doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dinner I love is Lentil Butternut Squash Soup. I really did not think I would enjoy this.. but I really like everything about it. It has just the right amount of spice and texture. I actually already made it a second time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_10/2017_01_10_bns.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;soup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also finally tried smoothie bowls. The first time, I used a fresh banana because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had time to freeze them yet- and without realizing the difference it makes, I was really confused as to why people make smoothie bowls. I actually just grabbed a straw to drink it. The next day, I decided to try again, and the frozen banana made all the difference. I LOVE this breakfast. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as great as eating frozen yogurt with great toppings. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_10/2017_01_10_bowl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;soup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac and I have been hitting the gym on his lunch break. It&amp;rsquo;s so great to have a gym partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_10/2017_01_10_gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A serious goal for 2017 is to improve my double unders. I mean, I only string together a max of 6, so there is a lot of room for improvement. Until then, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep beating myself up. Literally, whip marks on my legs, arms and sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll need to ice a knuckle or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_10/2017_01_10_rope.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;double&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every workout has been followed by a smoothie.. and I love, love, LOVE smoothies. I drink mine in like 2 minutes, while Zac takes a while- you know, drinking at a normal pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_10/2017_01_10_smoothie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smoothie&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Kindness Yoga is also holding a January Challenge. My goal is to get to 15 classes this month. I went to 4 classes last week, and they make such a huge difference in how I feel. It&amp;rsquo;s been hard- I prioritize it after my workout for the day, and sometimes I can hardly hold myself up because my muscles are so tired. Still worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_10/2017_01_10_yoga.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;soup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone has had a great start to the year! It was a cold week here in Denver, but we had a great week nonetheless. I have been re-watching Downton Abbey&amp;ndash; on Monday I realized I could stream Amazon Video through the XBox, and I am THRILLED. Truth is, I missed the last season, and I need to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them playing pretty much all day while I work on different CodeAcademy/Computer Projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_comp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;downton&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of computer projects&amp;mdash; on Wednesday I lured a friend out for drinks so that I could question her about WebDev and local programs. She was an awesome source of information (as well as an awesome person)- and I have a lot to consider. Wednesday this coming week I am attending an info session at Turing School, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start applying and see what happens. It might take a few tries, but I am loving everything I&amp;rsquo;m learning, and I am ready to move forward at a faster pace!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night we went to the Botanic Gardens for an Off The Clock event. The same friend above invited us, and we meet another couple there. It was a fun little night. I just LOVE walking around the gardens. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for summer- I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just go and sit a couple days a week- because. It also makes me wish I could grow things, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, keeping plants alive is not my strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_gardens.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we were planning on snowboarding, but were just too sore to make it up. Instead, we slept in and took care of some things around the apartment. In the morning, we walked to Panera Bread to get a loaf (and a Caramel Latte) to go with our bean-less Chili. I made a large batch in December and froze portions for trips to the mountain. I had already thawed one, so chili for lunch it was! Rexy loved the walk- and he gets more compliments, laughs and smiles when he wears his boots. Seriously, no one is immune to the cuteness that is dog boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_panera.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Panera&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got home, it was straight to the paw-wash! Of course, he was filthy, and overjoyed by the prospect of being hosed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_dogbath.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon I finished up another jar of Justin&amp;rsquo;s Almond Butter. I have been drinking SO MANY smoothies, and eating so many smoothie bowls, that I needed a cost effective option. I mentioned this to Zac, and an hour later, he was in the kitchen whipping up a batch of his first ever homemade PB! Guys- ITS AMAZING. Now, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for peanuts we can buy in bulk&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_pb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, it was FOOTBALL DAY. How about them Steelers? Gosh I am so excited about this post season. After the Steelers game, I headed to the gym- where I caught most of the Packers Giants game, and the Golden Globes Red Carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_elip.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TV&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for Restorative Yoga at Kindness. I love this weekly class- its the perfect way to wrap up a week! It was a particularly great class- and afterwards, Zac met me with Rex to walk home. Always the gentleman, he carries my Yoga mat like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_yoga.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s 2017 already. I will say, that being back in Denver finally feels like home and not just a vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_denver.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;In December I finished 11 books. That&amp;rsquo;s CRAZY! I think that I associate the holiday season with curling up with a book.. and therefore take every opportunity to do so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books:
  The Graveyard Book Vol 1,&lt;br /&gt;
  The Graveyard Book Vol 2,&lt;br /&gt;
  Winter Stroll,
  Winter Storms,
  Eligible,
  Crooked Kingdom,
  The Woman in Cabin 10,
  All The Time in the World,
  A Man Called Ove,
  Paper Princess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_05/reads_GYB.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Graveyard&#34; /&gt;
The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, and Craig P. Russell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graveyard Book volumes were beautiful. I always wanted to get to this book- and when a friend tagged the graphic novel in her banned books post, it brought them up to the top of my list. I actually had hoped to read them in time for Halloween- but other library loans were ending and it got side tracked until December. I digresss.. This was a wonderful story- I love all the characters, and the different ways you can interpret the story itself. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars | &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_05/reads_Stroll.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;stroll&#34; /&gt;
Winter Stroll(Winter 2) by Elin Hilderbrand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up the first book in this series, Winter Street, while I was visiting my family for Thanksgiving. The book was sitting on my Aunts coffee table, and I was instantly grabbed by the cover- the beautiful red door, and I wanted a holiday read. I finished it in just over a day, and really enjoyed reading it. Then I had to pick up this one. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_05/reads_storm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;storm&#34; /&gt;
Winter Storms(Winter 3) by Elin Hilderbrand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to summarize these books individually, because they really form a cohesive story. There are ups, there are downs. It shows how a family loves, grieves, and continues to move through life. A great holiday series. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_05/reads_eligible.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;eligible&#34; /&gt;
Eligible: A Modern Retelling of Pride and Prejudice by Curtis Sittenfeld&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book club book! Alright, so I moved in July- but I miss my book club! They keep me in loop with what they are reading, and I try to read them even if I&amp;rsquo;m not there for the fantastic conversation and great food/drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, I needed to read this. I WILL READ ANY FORM OF PRIDE AND PREJUDICE EVER. So, did I like this book? YES. I loved it. ITS P&amp;amp;P! In the beginning I was a little irritated by the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; aspect, but after a few chapters I fell into the new rhythm and I honestly like what they did with the characters. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping this one. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars (bias)&lt;/p&gt;

Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bardugo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaz and his crew are BA. Seriously. It makes me want to climb over roofs and scheme! This book, like the first, will keep you on your toes. Not even you will know what Kaz is up to, until he wants you to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without giving spoilers, I will say that this final book tied into the Grishaverse and I was SO pleasantly surprised by that! &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

The Woman in Cabin 10 by Ruth Ware&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first few chapters, I was really concerned that this book would be too much like Girl on the Train (which was a great book, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read the same story)..(unless its p&amp;amp;p). It wasn&amp;rsquo;t! A tale all of its own. I was surprised, I think the ending was brilliant, and I recommend! &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

All the Time in the World by Caroline Angell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was so heart breaking and uplifting at the same time. Not uplifting in a everything turns out perfect way, but in a life goes on way. I cannot imagine the burden of the loss these characters face, and yet, I feel like Angell did a wonderful job of showing us different aspects of being human and helped me relate to the characters. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_05/reads_ove.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ove&#34; /&gt;
A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;READ THIS BOOK! So, three chapters into this book I loved Ove. 5 Chapters in I said it would be one of the best books I read in 2016. By the end, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite books ever. Ove is reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen from the movie UP and has a bit of Gran Torino to it as well. One page, Ove will have you laughing, and the next he&amp;rsquo;ll have you in tears. I think that I learned something from Ove, and that we can always use a new prespective. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I read Paper Princess by Erin Watt; I don&amp;rsquo;t have a picture of this book, and I gave it zero stars on Goodreads. Why? Because I was so shocked by the book that I was not ready to process it. I&amp;rsquo;m still not, so I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off on that. Here is what I will say: The main character is a girl in high school. She meets a boy and it becomes more of an erotic genre than what I had expected- I expected a YA book! Now, I see people saying this is NA&amp;ndash; I DO NOT AGREE. NA should bridge the gap of teen and adult- but if I was doing Readers Advisory for New Adult, I would NOT include this as an option (and if you are, perhaps you should mention the main theme). Hey, as far as erotic novels go- it was okay. But NA? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stars are based on what I gave the book on Goodreads. However, you should know that I am particularly stingy with my 5 stars. Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t read bad books. As in, I might start a book, and if I don&amp;rsquo;t like it, I put it down. Life is too short to read bad books.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a crazy week, but it was full of family, friends and ended with the start of the New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_01/chrismukka.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chrismukkah&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve we drove up to Rochester to see my Aunt and cousins. My Aunt throws a &amp;ldquo;Chrismukkah&amp;rdquo; party, and her best friend brings her two adorable girls, her husband, and their parents. It was great to see them all again- to practice my lazy ASL and get an insight to RSL (The grandparents speak RSL and know hardly any ASL!). It was a lot of fun, it&amp;rsquo;s always crazy to see how fast those kids grow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_01/snap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chrismukkah&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas day we spent with Zac&amp;rsquo;s family (and OF COURSE, Cheered on the STEELRS!). It was a really great day, and it was such a wonderful time of year to catch up with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were in town we got to visit some new local places- a brewery, a cider mill and a coffee place (which we ended up at more than once). Everything we had was awesome, and I hope these local businesses are really successful this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_01/drinks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;drinks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also stopped at Wegmans, so that I could get my fill of Wegmans-brand products. Call me crazy, but the White Shells Mac &amp;amp; Cheese is unlike any other brand. We actually got flagged going through airport security because I stuck 12 boxes in Zac&amp;rsquo;s carry on&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of getting home- thankfully Zac is a seasoned flier now! We arrived at the airport and it was completely closed down for suspicious activity. Zac called the nearest airport, and got us out from there. Luckily we had great family members driving us all around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_01/airport.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;airport&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it home late Thursday, and were greeted Friday by a BEAUTIFUL Denver Winter day. It was 60 degrees! So, after picking up Rex, we took a walk to Avanti&amp;rsquo;s for lunch. We love it there. So much to choose from, and it all tastes so fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end the year, we ended up dog sitting for a dog friend. Leo was a sweet addition to the evening, and we spent some time cuddling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_01/nye.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dogs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you had a great holiday season! HAPPY 2017!&lt;/p&gt;
