<p>(How great is that sweatshirt thought? It&rsquo;s IndyBrand and I want ALL THE THINGS).</p>

<p>Monday morning Zac was off to LA for work! Rex and I went for a great walk. The sun was out, and after I felt pretty engergized.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_riverfront.jpg" alt="walk riverfront" /></p>

<p>During the day I finished up some work on the computer. That night, Shadow hunters aired and I was SO excited about it. So, after yoga, Rex and I settled in for a great show. About half way through Zac called, and I was whispering. He asked what was wrong- Oh, nothing, just in the middle of a show- ya know? Haha but it was practically over so we still caught up on his first day.</p>

<p>Tuesday was GORGEOUS! I woke up and went to Yoga with one of my favorite teachers. After, I grabbed a lavender honey latte at Carbon Beverage. It was SO GOOD. I didn&rsquo;t get anything to eat, but look at the picture- I will NEED to go back and get a huge cinnamon bun someday (with Zac, to help).</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_carbon.jpg" alt="carbon" /></p>

<p>Rex and I sat in the sun on our patio. It&rsquo;s the perfect area- you&rsquo;re totally blocked from the wind, but have full sun access! I was hot sitting in my tank.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_out1.jpg" alt="sunny day" /></p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_out2.jpg" alt="sunny day" /></p>

<p>Wednesday I woke up and decided to run some errands. We had some gift cards from Christmas- and that is my favorite way to shop! First I headed to Barnes and Noble- where I perused the shelves, tables, and displays before buying the two books I knew I was going to buy (but, as always, I was tempted). I also added a bunch of books to my Goodreads to-read section. Sighs. I bought the Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale, which I don&rsquo;t own and need to re-read, and Bridget Jones&rsquo;s Diary- which I have never read! Honest: I have high expectations there. We&rsquo;ll see when I get around to them. All my library holds came in at the same time, so prioritizing is an issue-</p>

<p>Next stop was literally right next door, Pier One. I use to buy wine glasses there EVERY YEAR. Seriously, they have these beautiful huge goblet like glasses (but more regular size than toyish)&hellip; with the perfect thin glass lip. Every year I would break at least 2, and replace them after Christmas. Until last year, when I bought a bunch of stainless steel (not as great, but still pretty great with the added bonus of not breaking into my disposal).  So this year, I found a soft fluffy pillow and a candle. Trying to be minimal means that I look for things that don&rsquo;t take up too much space, and are functional.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_shopping.jpg" alt="shopping" /></p>

<p>Since I was in the area- I also stopped at Ikea. I needed some food storage containers, and you can&rsquo;t beat their prices. I also stumbled upon a blanket/pillow cover display and got a few things to change up what I had on the couch (going along with the Pier 1 pillow).</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_couch.jpg" alt="couch" /></p>

<p>Then, in the afternoon- I hit a wall. Just totally completely exhausted! I took a really long nap with my new pillow and blanket. So that was great. It was also still really nice out- so for the third day in a row, I was able to open the windows and get some fresh air in the apartment.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_window.jpg" alt="dog" /></p>

<p>Wednesday night I went to an info session at Turing. (AND I HAVE SO MUCH NEWS FOR THAT WORLD- but that&rsquo;ll come in a later post). For now, just know that I got to wear my new shoes that I got for Christmas! Zac&rsquo;s sister gave them to me and I love them!</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_shoes.jpg" alt="dog" /></p>

<p>Before Zac got home on Thursday night I headed to Happy Hour at Avanti&rsquo;s with a friend. She invited a huge group, and everyone brought more people. There ended up being like 20-25 of us, and everyone was really great. Before, every time we went to Avanti, I would look at the bar area thinking &lsquo;I need to get here some night&rsquo;, and it was definitely what I expected. I can&rsquo;t wait to take Zac there some time for drinks- and to introduce him to some of the people I met that night!  When Zac got on the train, I walked the two blocks home. I was so busy talking, I got NO pictures. I&rsquo;ll have to work on that.</p>

<p>On Friday, I got the most unexpected and perfectly timed box ever. My dear friend, who I admire and am so lucky to know, sent me a holiday/care package. We&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about life. Actually, we always do, and always will. I&rsquo;m lucky to know her.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_gift2.jpg" alt="gift" /></p>

<p>Zac was back from LA, so in the morning we took Rex for a walk and grabbed coffee at ink.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_ink.jpg" alt="ink" /></p>

<p>Friday I watched a couple episodes of Lemony Snicket- while doing some work. After Zac got off work- we FINALLY went and saw Rogue One! IT WAS GREAT. We had tried to go for weeks, but the AMC Flatiron was totally sold out. I&rsquo;m a sucker for the lay down movie theater, so we kept waiting. We loved it!</p>

<p>Saturday we went for a long walk. It was nice outside, but not great. We walked to a few different areas we hadn&rsquo;t explored yet, so that was nice.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_train.jpg" alt="gift" /></p>

<p>That night, we had tickets to the Mammoth game! We use to love going to lax games in Buffalo, and were pretty excited to have a team here in Denver. First we stopped for drinks and apps at a place called Public School 303. It was adorable! Decorated for school- they have flash cards on the walls, and menus that look like composition notebooks. Plus, the food and drinks (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> liter of wine on happy hour!) were fantastic. The wings reminded me a place my brother and I went as kids- they had the BEST wings, so that&rsquo;s a high compliment.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_ps3032.jpg" alt="public school" /></p>

<p>Then we walked to the game and had so much fun! I can&rsquo;t wait to go again. It was a really close game too- we won.</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_lax.jpg" alt="mammoth" /></p>

<p>Sunday was FOOTBALL DAY. The games were CRAZY! I am stoked that the Steelers won, and I can&rsquo;t wait to cheer them on this weekend (and every other day, GO STEELERS!)</p>

<p><img src="https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01_17_dog_nap.jpg" alt="rex" /></p>

<p>The rest of the weekend was filled in with dog cuddles, walks, and trips to the gym. We also started watching The Man at High Castle, and I think that&rsquo;s going to be a great show.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;ll wrap up.. I have a delicious smelling coconut lemon curry to go eat. Exciting news coming soon.</p>
