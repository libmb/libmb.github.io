      <description>Back in July we moved out of our house in NY. It was a 1,452 sqft house (not including the full finished basement, or the bonus room above the garage). We moved from a house with four bedrooms, and two bathrooms to a one bed, one bath apartment. A mere 659 sqft. Here, my friends, is how we make it work..
FULL DISCLOSURE: We also have a storage unit. It&amp;rsquo;s small, and contains our spare tires, tool box and bikes.</description>
