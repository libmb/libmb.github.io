      <description>Wednesday night I went to my second hackathon! This one was hosted by name.com. The premise was we were given a domain name (cloud.denver) and two hours to make the best website for that domain. A lot of people showed up- and the place was packed! We ended up with a team that was wayy too big for a two hour hackathon- 10 people.
Our team name was DARE (given to us by the host).</description>
