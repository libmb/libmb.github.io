      <description>&lt;p&gt;SO MANY PHOTOS IN THIS POST&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/dognight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Insert Random Dog Pic here&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday was a prepare for the week day! Steph and Geoff had just left on Saturday, so I spend Sunday catching up around the house, grabbing groceries, and mostly meal prepping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/lastbreak1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;breakfast&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/lastbreak2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;breakfast&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/lastlunch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lunch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at the container store, and Zac ensured that I &lt;em&gt;contained myself&lt;/em&gt;. Still my fav.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/csstore.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Container Store&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday night was craft night! I headed over to Cojo&amp;rsquo;s with my banner supplies for Stephs Shower!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/craftnight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night Zac and I did some work while on the couch. I realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t watch a SINGLE SUPERNATURAL since gSchool started. WHICH IS CRAZY. How will I ever catch up at this rate? So I put that on..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/supercomp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;breakfast&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night Zac went to a Learn to Code Colorado meetup with me. I&amp;rsquo;ll be TA-ing a class this month, and wanted to get some hands on experience. It was also great because Zac got to meet some of my instructors and peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/ltcc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;LTCC&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac snagged a picture of me in my natural element (because helping)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/ltcc2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;LTCC&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday after class/work we went to the gym at the Galvanize/Pivotal building. After getting my moves in, Zac and I did a row OFF! It was fun, but mostly it was hard, lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/gym2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/gym3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/row.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing we knew it was FRIDAY! I wore my new CF shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/cfshirt.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cloud Foundry&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mel and Cody planned a layover in Denver on their way to Mexico for their honeymoon! Zac met them at the airport at 6; and at 7 we headed to Avanti for dinner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/mel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mel &amp;amp; Cody&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/melcod.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mel &amp;amp; Cody&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/allfour.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mel &amp;amp; Cody&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time to head back to the airport! We grabbed icecream from Milkbox at union first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/icecream.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mel &amp;amp; Cody&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the MOST AMAZING flavor. Seriously. Try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/straw.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mel &amp;amp; Cody&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/mctrain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mel &amp;amp; Cody&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the shortest visit, but it was good to see them and hug them! I hope they have a great vacation in sunny Mexico!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of SUN, our weather has been kind of crazy this week. But it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been awful, and we had some SPECTACULAR days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/sunset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Insert Random Dog Pic here&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/sunsnow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Insert Random Dog Pic here&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday- I hack-a-thon-ed. Read that post for details!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we met up with Joe and his family for a quick dinner and some Ciders. They have seriously cute kids, and I had fun playing with them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/joe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Joes baby&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I slept, like a lot. On Sunday I WAS DEAD TIRED (even after a full nights sleep). So, we woke up late, went to the gym, and after a long day, ran errands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the library and returned my books. I also cancelled all my holds. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read a single page in three weeks.  A SINGLE PAGE. Oh well.. in 5 months I&amp;rsquo;ll be back at it, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/bookbreakup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;library returns&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got home, I meal prepped while listening to the new Ed Sheeran Album on Spotify. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/thisbreak.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meal Prep&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/thisbreak2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meal Prep&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/thisdinner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meal Prep&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously can&amp;rsquo;t explain how much simpler meal prepping makes the week. It&amp;rsquo;s an investment on Sunday, but there is NO way I could eat healthy like this during the week otherwise. Here is a day(insert smoothie):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_03/2017_03_05/allmeal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meal Prep&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is PRETTY CRAZY around here, but I am loving every bit of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we cleaned up around the house- then headed to the airport to meet Steph &amp;amp; Geoff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/airport.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sign&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Steph brought supplies to restock our Wegmans necessities! &lt;em&gt;the best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/wegmans.png&#34; alt=&#34;Food&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were so excited to have guests, and there were so many places we wanted to take them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening we headed over to Galvanize, so I could show all three around my new school. We met an instructor and one of my cohort peers who was getting some work in. Zac and Geoff also squeezed in a game of ping pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gschool.png&#34; alt=&#34;Galvanize&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we headed over to McLoughlins for a drink before going to Zengo for dinner with Zac and Stephs cousin, Danielle and her boyfriend Tim. After, we were still a little hungry, so we walked up to Littleman for some ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/littleman.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;little man&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday we went to Eldora for a day of skiing/snowboarding. It was a pretty nice day, we were actually really warm but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to trek back to the car to ditch our jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/eldora.png&#34; alt=&#34;skiing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night we headed out. First we stopped at Avanti for drinks and food. Then we went all the way to Larimer where we got a drink and took in the gorgeous view that is Larimer at nighttime. On the way home, we stopped by Rocket Fizz because its fun to browse candies that were around during our childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/avanti_lar.png&#34; alt=&#34;avanti and larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday we went to the Botanic Gardens. It was SCFD Free day! It was free, and I am obsessed with the Gardens so it was a no brainer. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s winter, and so everything is dead. It was a little lackluster but the rainforest was still pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gardens.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;botanic gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we drove out to Boulder to do some walking along Pearl St. It was cold in the wind, but the sun was nice. We stopped for food and had the worst service.. but overall it was a nice day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday night we headed to the hockey game!!!! And when we got there, it was empty! Ha, Zac had purchased tickets for a Tuesday game, thinking it was Monday. Instead we just walked over to PublicSchool303 for drinks and dinner. An old friend was in town, so she stopped by too and it was nice to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/nothockey.png&#34; alt=&#34;not hockey&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday while I was in class, everyone went up to Red Rocks to explore. After class, I met everyone at Denver Beer Co, and we headed to the ACTUAL hockey game! The Avalanche are literally the worst team in the NHL, but sports are fun so it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/hockey.png&#34; alt=&#34;hockey&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning Steph joined me at the gym!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym buddy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night Zac had gotten Steph and Geoff a hotel in Cherry Creek so they could have a night of vacation together! We went grocery shopping and did laundry&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday while I was in class, the group went to a brewery and an arcade. After, we went to Bones for dinner. It was a great meal, and the restaurant is nice and intimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/bones.png&#34; alt=&#34;bones dinner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was our LAST DAY. While I was in class Zac, Steph and Geoff headed to Keystone for some AWESOME skiing/snowboarding and I&amp;rsquo;m jealous! I would have loved to go, but i&amp;rsquo;ll get to next time. When I got home from school everyone was really tired and apparently the altitude was putting some stress on them. Zac stayed home while the three of us went down the road to My Brothers Bar for some dinner. It was ok.. but we were really hungry so it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, before leaving, we went and grabbed brunch at Carbon. We will miss them so much, but it was a GREAT week and we can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/carbon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carbon brunch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/bye.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bridge pic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
