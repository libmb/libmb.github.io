      <description>SO MANY PHOTOS IN THIS POST&amp;hellip;
Last Sunday was a prepare for the week day! Steph and Geoff had just left on Saturday, so I spend Sunday catching up around the house, grabbing groceries, and mostly meal prepping!
We stopped at the container store, and Zac ensured that I contained myself. Still my fav.
Monday night was craft night! I headed over to Cojo&amp;rsquo;s with my banner supplies for Stephs Shower!</description>

      <description>Saturday morning we cleaned up around the house- then headed to the airport to meet Steph &amp;amp; Geoff!
Luckily, Steph brought supplies to restock our Wegmans necessities! the best!
We were so excited to have guests, and there were so many places we wanted to take them!
Saturday evening we headed over to Galvanize, so I could show all three around my new school. We met an instructor and one of my cohort peers who was getting some work in.</description>
