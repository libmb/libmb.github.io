      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short week! Monday we were off for Presidents day! Tuesday we started off covering test based assessments. Right now, we are using them for some of our assessments- but I look forward to Q2 when we learn how to write them! Now we have an updated flow/map of Q1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/flow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flow chart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spent some more time on Responsive CSS. I will say that by the end of this week, I feel much better about the topic and like flex box a lot more. I also really respect mobile first design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/css.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;css&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early this week I realized that I had some fierce competition on CodeWars. Its healthy, but is making me try harder katas and i&amp;rsquo;m trying to fit more in. One morning I worked on one for like three hours, and when I went to submit it I got a server error. No worries, I had it copied. It was funny.. (and I&amp;rsquo;m still losing)..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/codewars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;codewars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we started JavaScript. I was super excited to switch it up and start another aspect of web dev. We covered the basics and did some assessments. During free time I headed upstairs to work from the &amp;lsquo;club galvanize&amp;rsquo; area. Stevie was in the classroom outside and I just love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/stevie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday after class, Galvanize had a guest speaker, the CTO at Rachio. I stayed to hear from him- about his company and the work they do (although, I have a friend who works there so I was already pretty familiar). It was really cool to see how involved their system is! If I had a yard I&amp;rsquo;d totally look into their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we learned DOM. I was not feeling well and it was really hard for me to process anything we learned. I took some medicine while on lunch and felt much better in the afternoon. I feel like I am getting better- but I still need to do some work to understand the basic concepts. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably dedicate some time to that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/domfiddle.png&#34; alt=&#34;js fiddle screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way to class Friday I stopped for a latte. Because friday. and latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/ink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ink coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning we had another guest speaker. This time it was Michael Dusing, a local UX Designer. He had a GREAT presentation about work, life and paths to success. I loved hearing from him, his slideshow was FANTASTIC and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hear from more design people. He also brought stickers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/guest.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Guest Speaker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we started another scrimmage day, while one-on-ones were going on. This week we worked on a pixel art creator. I got stuck a few places, and loved working with my table. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with what I accomplished in one day- but have some stretch goals I want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/pixel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel Art&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEEK ONE GALVANIZE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/firstdayofschoolpic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture First Day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day one, we played the name game &lt;em&gt;Mighty Michelle&lt;/em&gt; and met instructors, administrators, etc! Our first lesson was on &amp;lsquo;How to learn.&amp;rsquo; They served us a great lunch- wraps from protein bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/lunch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Protein Bar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs were super sore from runday on Sunday, and standing through the name game killed me! So, I sat on the ground. Nothing like a first impression-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/soreleg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ground sitting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we got another tour, received our key fobs and talked about the Galvanize Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/dayone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;White board&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to meet so many dogs! Kiki, as previously mentioned, is our class dog. Well- she is our residents dog so she&amp;rsquo;ll be hanging with us most days. The other two dogs belong to other instructors. Gosh I love being surrounded by them all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/dogs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dogs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After class on Monday, Galvanize organized a happy hour on the fourth floor to welcome us in. Everyone was invited (students, instructors, members).. and it was a pretty busy event! It was nice to meet some other people in the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/happyhour.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Happy Hour&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday our first lesson was on POLYA- or how to solve problems. The day started with a warm up logic puzzle. My group didn&amp;rsquo;t do so great- apparently it relied on a lot of math and that is not my strong suit! Things to work on&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we learned some command line and VIM. We had three assessments to work on- and things were officially getting started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/polya.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we started with another logic puzzle. This time my group nailed it. I still need to practice though. I think i&amp;rsquo;ll grab a book next time i&amp;rsquo;m out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons on Wednesday were Git, Github and HTML. My table and I got into a serious discussion trying to figure out branching- hence our great use of the whiteboard table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/branching.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Branch Pictures&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did the same when trying to conceptualize the process of setting remote vs. upstream with Git&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/upstream.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Upstream diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night there was a meetup at Galvanize for CodePen. I headed home to take care of Rex and grab some (PREPPED) dinner before going back. It was a really cool showcase of things people had made- how they made them, and why. At one point, a nine year old girl got up with her dad to show off her html/css project. I just about died- and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I can apply to work for her in 6 months (exaggerating, but, not by much- she might rule the world someday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/codepengroup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meetup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we started responsive CSS. I pretty much got into fights with flex box all day. Luckily I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone- and many of us found great tutorials and tools to help learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we admire Kiki in her natural state? She is SO CUTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/kiki.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sleeping kiki&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also introduced to a concept called courage time. Pretty much we dedicate one hour to learning something we don&amp;rsquo;t know. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to have mastery in the topic- or even a fluency, but the point is that in one hour you can learn a lot- and accomplish a lot, in a topic you previously knew nothing about. I look forward to using courage time to delve into topics we might not cover in class (like design!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday- the final day of module one, week one! In the morning we had a guest speaker. She was a previous student who talked about her time, and what she is doing now! Then it was scrimmage day! Through the day, the instructors met with all the students for one-on-one meetings. While not in a meeting- we were working on our own site (using the skills we covered this week). I worked on a personal site. At 3, as usual, the keg was tapped- but they also had wine on tap! I grabbed a glass- and got my Galvanize swag! It was a great way to end the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/wine.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wine&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/swag.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;swag&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All week I packed my bag with Larabars as M4. It was the first time I tried them, and I absolutely LOVE cookie dough. The other flavors are really good too! They&amp;rsquo;ll probably become a regular thing for me..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/larabar.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Larabar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Code Catchup</title>
      <link>https://libmb.github.io/post/2017_01_26/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://libmb.github.io/post/2017_01_26/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving to Denver in July, I have been working hard to learn how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/codewars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;codewars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way back in middle school, I ran a website. It was for quotes- which I am sure were not properly cited, but the site was cool, the cursor had a tail, and it was definitely pink. I was self taught. After school, I would come home and sit at the computer for hours trying to figure out how the code worked. How I could pick it apart and put it together. Slowly figuring out how I could get my site to do something new. I loved it. Then, the quote trend passed, and I moved away from that side of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first paraprofessional role, I found myself leading programs for kids. One of the first was a program using Scratch. I loved it. I had so much fun with those kids, and they were so creative. I realized that I was still really interested in learning how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/scratch1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scratch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I interviewed for a new position. The interviewer asked what I wanted to learn for myself in the next year- what were my personal goals? In response, I said I wanted to learn how to code. That I had wanted to, and that it would be a good thing to work on. OF COURSE, I really had no time. I signed up for a few online classes.. but never practiced enough to retain anything I was learning. I even joined the mailing list for Girls Who Code in Syracuse, but never made it to a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June, when we decided to make the move to Denver, I was taking Rex for a walk. I found myself once again thinking,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would really love to learn web development. Maybe, in like 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ll have the time to learn it and it can be a second career&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I realized, why wait? Why wait to learn, what I have already been waiting to learn? So, I got home, and brought it up with Zac. Now, I have an amazingly supportive husband. He was all for it, and he&amp;rsquo;s supported me every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskweek.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;weekday&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskwknd.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;weekend&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we moved, and almost every day since August, I have been coding. Learning through Codeacademy, Udacity and Codewars. On the weekends, Zac and I will pair up and work on projects together. All along, I have been working to be good enough to apply for a bootcamp. This month, I applied. I interviewed. I was accepted. AND in just over two weeks I will be starting the immersive web development program at Galvanize Platte! I&amp;rsquo;M SO EXCITED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rexsnout.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scratch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention right now that I still LOVE library science. It is my goal to combine all of the skills I have with the skills I&amp;rsquo;ll learn.  I have zero regrets when it comes to the decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made this far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/macbookpro.png&#34; alt=&#34;new computer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m prepping for the course. It&amp;rsquo;s intensive, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to prepare myself ahead of time. Adjusting my sleep schedule, hitting the gym early, spending time with meal plans! I&amp;rsquo;m also still learning- and getting use to my new Macbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rollingmacs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pair&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s going to be challenging, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, I love a good challenge. I love learning. I love being busy. And, I&amp;rsquo;m hecka excited. I can hardly wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting off 2017!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone has had a great start to the year! It was a cold week here in Denver, but we had a great week nonetheless. I have been re-watching Downton Abbey&amp;ndash; on Monday I realized I could stream Amazon Video through the XBox, and I am THRILLED. Truth is, I missed the last season, and I need to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them playing pretty much all day while I work on different CodeAcademy/Computer Projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_comp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;downton&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of computer projects&amp;mdash; on Wednesday I lured a friend out for drinks so that I could question her about WebDev and local programs. She was an awesome source of information (as well as an awesome person)- and I have a lot to consider. Wednesday this coming week I am attending an info session at Turing School, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start applying and see what happens. It might take a few tries, but I am loving everything I&amp;rsquo;m learning, and I am ready to move forward at a faster pace!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night we went to the Botanic Gardens for an Off The Clock event. The same friend above invited us, and we meet another couple there. It was a fun little night. I just LOVE walking around the gardens. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for summer- I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just go and sit a couple days a week- because. It also makes me wish I could grow things, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, keeping plants alive is not my strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_gardens.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we were planning on snowboarding, but were just too sore to make it up. Instead, we slept in and took care of some things around the apartment. In the morning, we walked to Panera Bread to get a loaf (and a Caramel Latte) to go with our bean-less Chili. I made a large batch in December and froze portions for trips to the mountain. I had already thawed one, so chili for lunch it was! Rexy loved the walk- and he gets more compliments, laughs and smiles when he wears his boots. Seriously, no one is immune to the cuteness that is dog boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_panera.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Panera&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got home, it was straight to the paw-wash! Of course, he was filthy, and overjoyed by the prospect of being hosed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_dogbath.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon I finished up another jar of Justin&amp;rsquo;s Almond Butter. I have been drinking SO MANY smoothies, and eating so many smoothie bowls, that I needed a cost effective option. I mentioned this to Zac, and an hour later, he was in the kitchen whipping up a batch of his first ever homemade PB! Guys- ITS AMAZING. Now, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for peanuts we can buy in bulk&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_pb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, it was FOOTBALL DAY. How about them Steelers? Gosh I am so excited about this post season. After the Steelers game, I headed to the gym- where I caught most of the Packers Giants game, and the Golden Globes Red Carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_elip.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TV&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for Restorative Yoga at Kindness. I love this weekly class- its the perfect way to wrap up a week! It was a particularly great class- and afterwards, Zac met me with Rex to walk home. Always the gentleman, he carries my Yoga mat like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_yoga.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s 2017 already. I will say, that being back in Denver finally feels like home and not just a vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_denver.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
