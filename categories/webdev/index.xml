      <description>WOW. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about a fast week. A hectic, crazy, week! Group projects are great, and in some ways hard! That being said, WE MADE IT.
We started off our week by reviewing our pencil work. We established our project, our ERD, the wireframes and user stories. We combined all our ideas- and made sure that each of us had the same understanding of MVP and stretch goals.
From there- this whole week was this:</description>

      <description>This week we rolled through information! We had a lot to learn before projects next week- and we all had some sort of anxiety about either getting groups, or starting the project. This week we dived deeper into SQL joins, auth &amp;amp; auth, REST/CRUD, server side validation and FINALLY got our teams.
When we came in on Tuesday, we some new writing on our wall. A new goal is for all of us to add to the wall before graduation.</description>

      <description>Wednesday night I went to my second hackathon! This one was hosted by name.com. The premise was we were given a domain name (cloud.denver) and two hours to make the best website for that domain. A lot of people showed up- and the place was packed! We ended up with a team that was wayy too big for a two hour hackathon- 10 people.
Our team name was DARE (given to us by the host).</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t take my pictures this week at Galvanize. Must have been too busy learning or something&amp;mdash;-
We dived into even more topics this week! Including DATABASES, psql, ddl/ddm, and server side applications.
This week was all about the breakouts. Attending smaller size classes, for shorter periods, on concentrated topics. It had a few hitches, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t the worst.
Monday morning we had a guest speaker- Teagan. A BA developer at massroots- who has automated her entire home.</description>

      <description>Week two of Mod 2 definitely picked up speed. After spending last week reviewing Q1, this week we dived into some new concepts- all gearing up for backend. We started: ES6, Express &amp;amp; Body parser.
Monday and Tuesday it was pretty cold. I really don&amp;rsquo;t mind being stuck in the basement when it&amp;rsquo;s snowy outside!
To start the week off on the right foot, I brought in CUPCAKES. Vanilla cupcakes with peanut buttercream frosting.</description>

      <description>I CAN&amp;rsquo;T BELIEVE ITS ALREADY QUARTER TWO. WHOOOP! Time is FLYING! The walk in on Monday morning felt pretty good. Ready to start again!
Monday and Tuesday we were reviewing Q1 materials to prep for our Wednesday Assessment. Tuesday was early day again. Proof that I was totally off my game is that I accidentally brewed two pots of coffee in one pot. I came out and saw it overflowing onto the counter- ugh!</description>

      <description>Wow, what a week! It seriously FLEW by. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll review some pictures from the week, then get into the nitty gritty of projects&amp;hellip;.
After the weekend, I decided that Monday was the best day to bring Rex into class. It works for our schedule, and fits better with the general flow at school. He only stayed a half day- because, projects. Also, HE SHAMED THE FAMILY by deciding to mark a classmates bag.</description>

      <description>Monday morning two classmates pulled together to bring in a BUNCH of doughnuts! They are for sure not on the plan- but I had one and it literally made me happy- so there&amp;rsquo;s that. (ps. they were awesome for doing that).
We started off the week with a guest speaker- a UX designer! It was a really interesting talk- and I appreciate seeing and hearing from different people in the tech field- who work in the various aspects of web development.</description>

      <description>HACK THE PLANET WAS SO MUCH FUN.
So Saturday I participated in my FIRST EVER HACKATHON. It was also the first ever gSchool hackathon. The event started around 8:30, but I showed up early to get put into a team. Since I&amp;rsquo;m still new to this world, and the event wanted to encourage cross cohort/location collaboration- I decided to go in as a single and get paired up with a group.</description>

      <description>Week three of module one is officially complete! At the end of the week, I am feeling pretty great!
Monday we covered objects, arrays and intro to jQuery. I realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked at objects in months.. and for sure needed a refresher. I liked learning jQuery&amp;mdash; although I know to be careful in using it for all things in the future.
This week we had Roberto as our floating instructor.</description>

      <description>A short week! Monday we were off for Presidents day! Tuesday we started off covering test based assessments. Right now, we are using them for some of our assessments- but I look forward to Q2 when we learn how to write them! Now we have an updated flow/map of Q1:
We also spent some more time on Responsive CSS. I will say that by the end of this week, I feel much better about the topic and like flex box a lot more.</description>

      <description>WEEK ONE GALVANIZE!
On day one, we played the name game Mighty Michelle and met instructors, administrators, etc! Our first lesson was on &amp;lsquo;How to learn.&amp;rsquo; They served us a great lunch- wraps from protein bar!
My legs were super sore from runday on Sunday, and standing through the name game killed me! So, I sat on the ground. Nothing like a first impression-
In the afternoon, we got another tour, received our key fobs and talked about the Galvanize Culture.</description>

      <description>Since moving to Denver in July, I have been working hard to learn how to code.
Way back in middle school, I ran a website. It was for quotes- which I am sure were not properly cited, but the site was cool, the cursor had a tail, and it was definitely pink. I was self taught. After school, I would come home and sit at the computer for hours trying to figure out how the code worked.</description>

      <description>Hope everyone has had a great start to the year! It was a cold week here in Denver, but we had a great week nonetheless. I have been re-watching Downton Abbey&amp;ndash; on Monday I realized I could stream Amazon Video through the XBox, and I am THRILLED. Truth is, I missed the last season, and I need to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them playing pretty much all day while I work on different CodeAcademy/Computer Projects.</description>
