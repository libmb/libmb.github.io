      <description>Saturday morning we cleaned up around the house- then headed to the airport to meet Steph &amp;amp; Geoff!
Luckily, Steph brought supplies to restock our Wegmans necessities! the best!
We were so excited to have guests, and there were so many places we wanted to take them!
Saturday evening we headed over to Galvanize, so I could show all three around my new school. We met an instructor and one of my cohort peers who was getting some work in.</description>

      <description>Last free weekend before Galvanize was wonderful! Thursday evening I headed over to Galvanize for an informal get together- saying HI before starting on Monday. I met Kiki, our class dog!
Thursday night we headed out to Avanti for dinner. It was a gorgeous night, and we stopped by Prost first.
It was so nice to sit outside and chat about life. Then we headed to Avanti, we sat downstairs, ordered some pizza for National pizza day, and went up to the roof for a little while.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s only been 9 days since my last post, and I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 9 days! After a slow start to last week, the second half and weekend flew by! I think this post will be a long one&amp;hellip;
(How great is that sweatshirt thought? It&amp;rsquo;s IndyBrand and I want ALL THE THINGS).
Monday morning Zac was off to LA for work! Rex and I went for a great walk.</description>

      <description>Hope everyone has had a great start to the year! It was a cold week here in Denver, but we had a great week nonetheless. I have been re-watching Downton Abbey&amp;ndash; on Monday I realized I could stream Amazon Video through the XBox, and I am THRILLED. Truth is, I missed the last season, and I need to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them playing pretty much all day while I work on different CodeAcademy/Computer Projects.</description>
