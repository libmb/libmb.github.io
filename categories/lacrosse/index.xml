      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s only been 9 days since my last post, and I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 9 days! After a slow start to last week, the second half and weekend flew by! I think this post will be a long one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_indy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog cuddles&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(How great is that sweatshirt thought? It&amp;rsquo;s IndyBrand and I want ALL THE THINGS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday morning Zac was off to LA for work! Rex and I went for a great walk. The sun was out, and after I felt pretty engergized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_riverfront.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;walk riverfront&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I finished up some work on the computer. That night, Shadow hunters aired and I was SO excited about it. So, after yoga, Rex and I settled in for a great show. About half way through Zac called, and I was whispering. He asked what was wrong- Oh, nothing, just in the middle of a show- ya know? Haha but it was practically over so we still caught up on his first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was GORGEOUS! I woke up and went to Yoga with one of my favorite teachers. After, I grabbed a lavender honey latte at Carbon Beverage. It was SO GOOD. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get anything to eat, but look at the picture- I will NEED to go back and get a huge cinnamon bun someday (with Zac, to help).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_carbon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carbon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex and I sat in the sun on our patio. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect area- you&amp;rsquo;re totally blocked from the wind, but have full sun access! I was hot sitting in my tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_out1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunny day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_out2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunny day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I woke up and decided to run some errands. We had some gift cards from Christmas- and that is my favorite way to shop! First I headed to Barnes and Noble- where I perused the shelves, tables, and displays before buying the two books I knew I was going to buy (but, as always, I was tempted). I also added a bunch of books to my Goodreads to-read section. Sighs. I bought the Handmaid&amp;rsquo;s Tale, which I don&amp;rsquo;t own and need to re-read, and Bridget Jones&amp;rsquo;s Diary- which I have never read! Honest: I have high expectations there. We&amp;rsquo;ll see when I get around to them. All my library holds came in at the same time, so prioritizing is an issue-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop was literally right next door, Pier One. I use to buy wine glasses there EVERY YEAR. Seriously, they have these beautiful huge goblet like glasses (but more regular size than toyish)&amp;hellip; with the perfect thin glass lip. Every year I would break at least 2, and replace them after Christmas. Until last year, when I bought a bunch of stainless steel (not as great, but still pretty great with the added bonus of not breaking into my disposal).  So this year, I found a soft fluffy pillow and a candle. Trying to be minimal means that I look for things that don&amp;rsquo;t take up too much space, and are functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_shopping.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;shopping&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was in the area- I also stopped at Ikea. I needed some food storage containers, and you can&amp;rsquo;t beat their prices. I also stumbled upon a blanket/pillow cover display and got a few things to change up what I had on the couch (going along with the Pier 1 pillow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_couch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;couch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in the afternoon- I hit a wall. Just totally completely exhausted! I took a really long nap with my new pillow and blanket. So that was great. It was also still really nice out- so for the third day in a row, I was able to open the windows and get some fresh air in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_window.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night I went to an info session at Turing. (AND I HAVE SO MUCH NEWS FOR THAT WORLD- but that&amp;rsquo;ll come in a later post). For now, just know that I got to wear my new shoes that I got for Christmas! Zac&amp;rsquo;s sister gave them to me and I love them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Zac got home on Thursday night I headed to Happy Hour at Avanti&amp;rsquo;s with a friend. She invited a huge group, and everyone brought more people. There ended up being like 20-25 of us, and everyone was really great. Before, every time we went to Avanti, I would look at the bar area thinking &amp;lsquo;I need to get here some night&amp;rsquo;, and it was definitely what I expected. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to take Zac there some time for drinks- and to introduce him to some of the people I met that night!  When Zac got on the train, I walked the two blocks home. I was so busy talking, I got NO pictures. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I got the most unexpected and perfectly timed box ever. My dear friend, who I admire and am so lucky to know, sent me a holiday/care package. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking a lot about life. Actually, we always do, and always will. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to know her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_gift1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_gift2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac was back from LA, so in the morning we took Rex for a walk and grabbed coffee at ink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ink&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I watched a couple episodes of Lemony Snicket- while doing some work. After Zac got off work- we FINALLY went and saw Rogue One! IT WAS GREAT. We had tried to go for weeks, but the AMC Flatiron was totally sold out. I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for the lay down movie theater, so we kept waiting. We loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we went for a long walk. It was nice outside, but not great. We walked to a few different areas we hadn&amp;rsquo;t explored yet, so that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, we had tickets to the Mammoth game! We use to love going to lax games in Buffalo, and were pretty excited to have a team here in Denver. First we stopped for drinks and apps at a place called Public School 303. It was adorable! Decorated for school- they have flash cards on the walls, and menus that look like composition notebooks. Plus, the food and drinks (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; liter of wine on happy hour!) were fantastic. The wings reminded me a place my brother and I went as kids- they had the BEST wings, so that&amp;rsquo;s a high compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ps303.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;public school&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ps3032.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;public school&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we walked to the game and had so much fun! I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go again. It was a really close game too- we won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_pc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pepsi center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_lax.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mammoth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was FOOTBALL DAY. The games were CRAZY! I am stoked that the Steelers won, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to cheer them on this weekend (and every other day, GO STEELERS!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_dog_nap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the weekend was filled in with dog cuddles, walks, and trips to the gym. We also started watching The Man at High Castle, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a great show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll wrap up.. I have a delicious smelling coconut lemon curry to go eat. Exciting news coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_lcsoup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;soup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
