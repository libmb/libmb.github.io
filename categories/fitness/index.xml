      <description>So this past week was my first at Galvanize, but there was time outside of class! I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to break up my posts between school work, and life outside of class..
This past week Zac was in Portland, so every night we caught up on my day! I think he was as excited as me that I started school.
Monday I came home and just relaxed. All week it was really great that I had easy meals ready to go.</description>

      <description>Last free weekend before Galvanize was wonderful! Thursday evening I headed over to Galvanize for an informal get together- saying HI before starting on Monday. I met Kiki, our class dog!
Thursday night we headed out to Avanti for dinner. It was a gorgeous night, and we stopped by Prost first.
It was so nice to sit outside and chat about life. Then we headed to Avanti, we sat downstairs, ordered some pizza for National pizza day, and went up to the roof for a little while.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been so gorgeous here lately, that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that a week ago everything was covered in ice! We had a nice day, and right as the sun was setting, starting getting some drizzle. Well, it all turned to ice and our walk that night and the next morning was treacherous.
I am officially in the last week of the January 2017 Tone It Up Challenge! I&amp;rsquo;m loving it, and I plan to keep it up afterwards.</description>

      <description>Friday night we went out for Thai! As usual, Zac ordered the better dish. Mine was a little (way) too spicy for my likes, so I helped Z out a bit. It was good, but we&amp;rsquo;ll still be on the hunt for Denvers best Thai!
Saturday night we went out for a few drinks. We wanted to stay close, since Zac was still recovering. We headed to Zengo, but they had a huge Year of the Rooster celebration going on, and we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get in the door!</description>

      <description>Last week Rex and I had some movie dates. We watched The Secret Life of Pets (adorable) and The Legend of Tarzan (amazing). I even let him on the couch, because I. Am. Weak.
We had a few beautiful days, so we went on long walks in the highlands and lodo.
Zac got home last Thursday night, and he has been sick with an awful cold since.
Then, this weekend, Rex got some form of conjunctivitis.</description>

      <description>It takes 21 days to make a habit, and I&amp;rsquo;m on day 19 of Tone It Up! That&amp;rsquo;s 2 days from a habit? AND 2 days since &amp;ldquo;Ditch Day&amp;rdquo;. This week I&amp;rsquo;m feeling great again. Last week I had some ups and downs-
First, helpful tool of the week: CARDIO PLAYLIST ON SPOTIFY. Seriously love this list so much. After I finished my last audiobook, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into the next one I picked.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a week since I started Tone It Up! I&amp;rsquo;ve used the nutrition plan for Fit Girls a few times the past couple years, and while I loved the food, I started to get sick of the same recipes. It was time to switch things up!
So far, I&amp;rsquo;m loving the meals- and the daily workouts are definitely doable.
One dinner I love is Lentil Butternut Squash Soup.</description>

      <description>Hope everyone has had a great start to the year! It was a cold week here in Denver, but we had a great week nonetheless. I have been re-watching Downton Abbey&amp;ndash; on Monday I realized I could stream Amazon Video through the XBox, and I am THRILLED. Truth is, I missed the last season, and I need to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them playing pretty much all day while I work on different CodeAcademy/Computer Projects.</description>
