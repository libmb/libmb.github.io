      <description>Last week Rex and I had some movie dates. We watched The Secret Life of Pets (adorable) and The Legend of Tarzan (amazing). I even let him on the couch, because I. Am. Weak.
We had a few beautiful days, so we went on long walks in the highlands and lodo.
Zac got home last Thursday night, and he has been sick with an awful cold since.
Then, this weekend, Rex got some form of conjunctivitis.</description>
