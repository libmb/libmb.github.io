      <description>I am still feeling so incredibly spoiled for having Zac home. I know that he&amp;rsquo;ll be starting another project soon and be back to traveling, but I am loving having him home!
Monday I finally did something I have been thinking about for a while. I deactivated Facebook. Seriously, I have wanted to get it out of my life for awhile. I was spending too much time doing nothing on there- and actually just hated it.</description>

      <description>Time to recap the life portion of the school life balance from last week!
Monday at the gym ALL OF THE DUMBBELLS WERE THERE. I have never seen this before. People suck at picking up after themselves&amp;hellip;
Tuesday night we grilled on the roof. We were hoping to catch some Tennis up there on the TV- but apparently our complex has different subscriptions in different rooms.. So after, we ended up back in the apartment subscribing to tennis channel&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Energy was pretty low this week, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling fantastic some days- but it was a good week.
Monday night we rented Dr. Strange. IT WAS SO GOOD. It&amp;rsquo;s actually probably one of my favorite movies now. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to own it and watch it again and again&amp;hellip; I HOPE there is another (&amp;amp;soon).
Tuesday was my early day so we hit the gym and took it easy.
Wednesday Zac and I grabbed lunch at Brider.</description>
