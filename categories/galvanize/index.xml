      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short week! Monday we were off for Presidents day! Tuesday we started off covering test based assessments. Right now, we are using them for some of our assessments- but I look forward to Q2 when we learn how to write them! Now we have an updated flow/map of Q1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/flow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flow chart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spent some more time on Responsive CSS. I will say that by the end of this week, I feel much better about the topic and like flex box a lot more. I also really respect mobile first design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/css.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;css&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early this week I realized that I had some fierce competition on CodeWars. Its healthy, but is making me try harder katas and i&amp;rsquo;m trying to fit more in. One morning I worked on one for like three hours, and when I went to submit it I got a server error. No worries, I had it copied. It was funny.. (and I&amp;rsquo;m still losing)..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/codewars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;codewars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we started JavaScript. I was super excited to switch it up and start another aspect of web dev. We covered the basics and did some assessments. During free time I headed upstairs to work from the &amp;lsquo;club galvanize&amp;rsquo; area. Stevie was in the classroom outside and I just love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/stevie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday after class, Galvanize had a guest speaker, the CTO at Rachio. I stayed to hear from him- about his company and the work they do (although, I have a friend who works there so I was already pretty familiar). It was really cool to see how involved their system is! If I had a yard I&amp;rsquo;d totally look into their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we learned DOM. I was not feeling well and it was really hard for me to process anything we learned. I took some medicine while on lunch and felt much better in the afternoon. I feel like I am getting better- but I still need to do some work to understand the basic concepts. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably dedicate some time to that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/domfiddle.png&#34; alt=&#34;js fiddle screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way to class Friday I stopped for a latte. Because friday. and latte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/ink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ink coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning we had another guest speaker. This time it was Michael Dusing, a local UX Designer. He had a GREAT presentation about work, life and paths to success. I loved hearing from him, his slideshow was FANTASTIC and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hear from more design people. He also brought stickers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_24/guest.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Guest Speaker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we started another scrimmage day, while one-on-ones were going on. This week we worked on a pixel art creator. I got stuck a few places, and loved working with my table. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with what I accomplished in one day- but have some stretch goals I want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEEK ONE GALVANIZE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/firstdayofschoolpic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture First Day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day one, we played the name game &lt;em&gt;Mighty Michelle&lt;/em&gt; and met instructors, administrators, etc! Our first lesson was on &amp;lsquo;How to learn.&amp;rsquo; They served us a great lunch- wraps from protein bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/lunch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Protein Bar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs were super sore from runday on Sunday, and standing through the name game killed me! So, I sat on the ground. Nothing like a first impression-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/soreleg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ground sitting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we got another tour, received our key fobs and talked about the Galvanize Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/dayone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;White board&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to meet so many dogs! Kiki, as previously mentioned, is our class dog. Well- she is our residents dog so she&amp;rsquo;ll be hanging with us most days. The other two dogs belong to other instructors. Gosh I love being surrounded by them all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/dogs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dogs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After class on Monday, Galvanize organized a happy hour on the fourth floor to welcome us in. Everyone was invited (students, instructors, members).. and it was a pretty busy event! It was nice to meet some other people in the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/happyhour.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Happy Hour&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday our first lesson was on POLYA- or how to solve problems. The day started with a warm up logic puzzle. My group didn&amp;rsquo;t do so great- apparently it relied on a lot of math and that is not my strong suit! Things to work on&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we learned some command line and VIM. We had three assessments to work on- and things were officially getting started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/polya.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we started with another logic puzzle. This time my group nailed it. I still need to practice though. I think i&amp;rsquo;ll grab a book next time i&amp;rsquo;m out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons on Wednesday were Git, Github and HTML. My table and I got into a serious discussion trying to figure out branching- hence our great use of the whiteboard table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/branching.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Branch Pictures&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did the same when trying to conceptualize the process of setting remote vs. upstream with Git&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/upstream.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Upstream diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night there was a meetup at Galvanize for CodePen. I headed home to take care of Rex and grab some (PREPPED) dinner before going back. It was a really cool showcase of things people had made- how they made them, and why. At one point, a nine year old girl got up with her dad to show off her html/css project. I just about died- and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I can apply to work for her in 6 months (exaggerating, but, not by much- she might rule the world someday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/codepengroup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meetup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we started responsive CSS. I pretty much got into fights with flex box all day. Luckily I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone- and many of us found great tutorials and tools to help learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we admire Kiki in her natural state? She is SO CUTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/kiki.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sleeping kiki&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also introduced to a concept called courage time. Pretty much we dedicate one hour to learning something we don&amp;rsquo;t know. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to have mastery in the topic- or even a fluency, but the point is that in one hour you can learn a lot- and accomplish a lot, in a topic you previously knew nothing about. I look forward to using courage time to delve into topics we might not cover in class (like design!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday- the final day of module one, week one! In the morning we had a guest speaker. She was a previous student who talked about her time, and what she is doing now! Then it was scrimmage day! Through the day, the instructors met with all the students for one-on-one meetings. While not in a meeting- we were working on our own site (using the skills we covered this week). I worked on a personal site. At 3, as usual, the keg was tapped- but they also had wine on tap! I grabbed a glass- and got my Galvanize swag! It was a great way to end the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/wine.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wine&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/swag.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;swag&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All week I packed my bag with Larabars as M4. It was the first time I tried them, and I absolutely LOVE cookie dough. The other flavors are really good too! They&amp;rsquo;ll probably become a regular thing for me..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Code Catchup</title>
      <link>https://libmb.github.io/post/2017_01_26/</link>

      <guid>https://libmb.github.io/post/2017_01_26/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving to Denver in July, I have been working hard to learn how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/codewars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;codewars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way back in middle school, I ran a website. It was for quotes- which I am sure were not properly cited, but the site was cool, the cursor had a tail, and it was definitely pink. I was self taught. After school, I would come home and sit at the computer for hours trying to figure out how the code worked. How I could pick it apart and put it together. Slowly figuring out how I could get my site to do something new. I loved it. Then, the quote trend passed, and I moved away from that side of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first paraprofessional role, I found myself leading programs for kids. One of the first was a program using Scratch. I loved it. I had so much fun with those kids, and they were so creative. I realized that I was still really interested in learning how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/scratch1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scratch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I interviewed for a new position. The interviewer asked what I wanted to learn for myself in the next year- what were my personal goals? In response, I said I wanted to learn how to code. That I had wanted to, and that it would be a good thing to work on. OF COURSE, I really had no time. I signed up for a few online classes.. but never practiced enough to retain anything I was learning. I even joined the mailing list for Girls Who Code in Syracuse, but never made it to a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June, when we decided to make the move to Denver, I was taking Rex for a walk. I found myself once again thinking,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would really love to learn web development. Maybe, in like 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ll have the time to learn it and it can be a second career&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I realized, why wait? Why wait to learn, what I have already been waiting to learn? So, I got home, and brought it up with Zac. Now, I have an amazingly supportive husband. He was all for it, and he&amp;rsquo;s supported me every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskweek.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;weekday&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/deskwknd.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;weekend&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we moved, and almost every day since August, I have been coding. Learning through Codeacademy, Udacity and Codewars. On the weekends, Zac and I will pair up and work on projects together. All along, I have been working to be good enough to apply for a bootcamp. This month, I applied. I interviewed. I was accepted. AND in just over two weeks I will be starting the immersive web development program at Galvanize Platte! I&amp;rsquo;M SO EXCITED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rexsnout.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scratch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention right now that I still LOVE library science. It is my goal to combine all of the skills I have with the skills I&amp;rsquo;ll learn.  I have zero regrets when it comes to the decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made this far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/macbookpro.png&#34; alt=&#34;new computer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m prepping for the course. It&amp;rsquo;s intensive, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to prepare myself ahead of time. Adjusting my sleep schedule, hitting the gym early, spending time with meal plans! I&amp;rsquo;m also still learning- and getting use to my new Macbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_26/rollingmacs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pair&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s going to be challenging, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, I love a good challenge. I love learning. I love being busy. And, I&amp;rsquo;m hecka excited. I can hardly wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
