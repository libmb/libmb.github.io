      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we cleaned up around the house- then headed to the airport to meet Steph &amp;amp; Geoff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/airport.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sign&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Steph brought supplies to restock our Wegmans necessities! &lt;em&gt;the best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/wegmans.png&#34; alt=&#34;Food&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were so excited to have guests, and there were so many places we wanted to take them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening we headed over to Galvanize, so I could show all three around my new school. We met an instructor and one of my cohort peers who was getting some work in. Zac and Geoff also squeezed in a game of ping pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gschool.png&#34; alt=&#34;Galvanize&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we headed over to McLoughlins for a drink before going to Zengo for dinner with Zac and Stephs cousin, Danielle and her boyfriend Tim. After, we were still a little hungry, so we walked up to Littleman for some ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/littleman.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;little man&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday we went to Eldora for a day of skiing/snowboarding. It was a pretty nice day, we were actually really warm but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to trek back to the car to ditch our jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/eldora.png&#34; alt=&#34;skiing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night we headed out. First we stopped at Avanti for drinks and food. Then we went all the way to Larimer where we got a drink and took in the gorgeous view that is Larimer at nighttime. On the way home, we stopped by Rocket Fizz because its fun to browse candies that were around during our childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/avanti_lar.png&#34; alt=&#34;avanti and larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday we went to the Botanic Gardens. It was SCFD Free day! It was free, and I am obsessed with the Gardens so it was a no brainer. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s winter, and so everything is dead. It was a little lackluster but the rainforest was still pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gardens.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;botanic gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we drove out to Boulder to do some walking along Pearl St. It was cold in the wind, but the sun was nice. We stopped for food and had the worst service.. but overall it was a nice day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday night we headed to the hockey game!!!! And when we got there, it was empty! Ha, Zac had purchased tickets for a Tuesday game, thinking it was Monday. Instead we just walked over to PublicSchool303 for drinks and dinner. An old friend was in town, so she stopped by too and it was nice to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/nothockey.png&#34; alt=&#34;not hockey&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday while I was in class, everyone went up to Red Rocks to explore. After class, I met everyone at Denver Beer Co, and we headed to the ACTUAL hockey game! The Avalanche are literally the worst team in the NHL, but sports are fun so it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/hockey.png&#34; alt=&#34;hockey&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning Steph joined me at the gym!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gym buddy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night Zac had gotten Steph and Geoff a hotel in Cherry Creek so they could have a night of vacation together! We went grocery shopping and did laundry&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday while I was in class, the group went to a brewery and an arcade. After, we went to Bones for dinner. It was a great meal, and the restaurant is nice and intimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/bones.png&#34; alt=&#34;bones dinner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was our LAST DAY. While I was in class Zac, Steph and Geoff headed to Keystone for some AWESOME skiing/snowboarding and I&amp;rsquo;m jealous! I would have loved to go, but i&amp;rsquo;ll get to next time. When I got home from school everyone was really tired and apparently the altitude was putting some stress on them. Zac stayed home while the three of us went down the road to My Brothers Bar for some dinner. It was ok.. but we were really hungry so it worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, before leaving, we went and grabbed brunch at Carbon. We will miss them so much, but it was a GREAT week and we can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_25/carbon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carbon brunch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last free weekend before Galvanize was wonderful! Thursday evening I headed over to Galvanize for an informal get together- saying HI before starting on Monday. I met Kiki, our class dog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/kiki.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kiki the dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday night we headed out to Avanti for dinner. It was a gorgeous night, and we stopped by Prost first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/prost.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Beer and City&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so nice to sit outside and chat about life. Then we headed to Avanti, we sat downstairs, ordered some pizza for National pizza day, and went up to the roof for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/avanti.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Avanti&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I spent a bunch of time sitting outside with Rex. It was really nice out, and that way Zac has some privacy during his work calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/outside.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Patio view&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent hours meal planning for the entire first module of Galvanize ( !4 weeks worth! )- The module is five weeks long, but we will have company the first week so it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to plan a bunch of meals when we&amp;rsquo;ll probably play the week by ear. Anyways, I was super impressed with my work. 4 weeks worth of 5 tone it up meals a day, complete with shopping lists and meal prep schedules. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/mealplan.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Computer screen&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday we went out for dinner again. Monday starts the tone it up seven day slim down- I hadn&amp;rsquo;t grabbed groceries yet- so it was a good opportunity to get out again. ALSO it was high 70s and we wanted to enjoy a patio! We went to Larimer and stopped at a wine bar. We did two wine tastings and enjoyed some appetizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/larzac.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Zac at Larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/larimer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Larimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home we stopped for coffee. Because love for coffee &amp;gt; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t drink coffee at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/amante.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Amante Coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we relaxed all day- caught up on some house stuff. Sunday morning I headed out for my hair appointment. Since moving to Denver i&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Clementines in the highlands. On Sunday they opened a new location in Stapleton, and my hairdresser will be working there from now on! I decided to go there- to keep her, and check out the new place. It was really nice, I ended up being the first customer at the new location on opening day. It&amp;rsquo;s located at Stanley Marketplace, this awesome old airplane hangar that has been converted to shops and restaurants/breweries. There was a crossfit place that looked awesome too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/clementines.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Clementines&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way out, I grabbed two lattes from Logan&amp;rsquo;s Coffee House. They were great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/logans.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday evening was meal plan time! I threw on the 90s playlist from Spotify, and got to work. Throughout I was snapping the process. I know that I snapped more to my story that day than I have ever before, combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/mealprep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;meal preping&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;shoes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt so good afterwards! 5 days of quality meals. As for fitness, my new shoes came in this week- and I had some really great workouts. It was nice to have Zac home all week again. It&amp;rsquo;s always great to have a gym buddy. We did some biking together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_02/2017_02_12/bike.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s only been 9 days since my last post, and I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 9 days! After a slow start to last week, the second half and weekend flew by! I think this post will be a long one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_indy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog cuddles&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(How great is that sweatshirt thought? It&amp;rsquo;s IndyBrand and I want ALL THE THINGS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday morning Zac was off to LA for work! Rex and I went for a great walk. The sun was out, and after I felt pretty engergized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_riverfront.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;walk riverfront&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I finished up some work on the computer. That night, Shadow hunters aired and I was SO excited about it. So, after yoga, Rex and I settled in for a great show. About half way through Zac called, and I was whispering. He asked what was wrong- Oh, nothing, just in the middle of a show- ya know? Haha but it was practically over so we still caught up on his first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was GORGEOUS! I woke up and went to Yoga with one of my favorite teachers. After, I grabbed a lavender honey latte at Carbon Beverage. It was SO GOOD. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get anything to eat, but look at the picture- I will NEED to go back and get a huge cinnamon bun someday (with Zac, to help).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_carbon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carbon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex and I sat in the sun on our patio. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect area- you&amp;rsquo;re totally blocked from the wind, but have full sun access! I was hot sitting in my tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_out1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunny day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_out2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunny day&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I woke up and decided to run some errands. We had some gift cards from Christmas- and that is my favorite way to shop! First I headed to Barnes and Noble- where I perused the shelves, tables, and displays before buying the two books I knew I was going to buy (but, as always, I was tempted). I also added a bunch of books to my Goodreads to-read section. Sighs. I bought the Handmaid&amp;rsquo;s Tale, which I don&amp;rsquo;t own and need to re-read, and Bridget Jones&amp;rsquo;s Diary- which I have never read! Honest: I have high expectations there. We&amp;rsquo;ll see when I get around to them. All my library holds came in at the same time, so prioritizing is an issue-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop was literally right next door, Pier One. I use to buy wine glasses there EVERY YEAR. Seriously, they have these beautiful huge goblet like glasses (but more regular size than toyish)&amp;hellip; with the perfect thin glass lip. Every year I would break at least 2, and replace them after Christmas. Until last year, when I bought a bunch of stainless steel (not as great, but still pretty great with the added bonus of not breaking into my disposal).  So this year, I found a soft fluffy pillow and a candle. Trying to be minimal means that I look for things that don&amp;rsquo;t take up too much space, and are functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_shopping.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;shopping&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was in the area- I also stopped at Ikea. I needed some food storage containers, and you can&amp;rsquo;t beat their prices. I also stumbled upon a blanket/pillow cover display and got a few things to change up what I had on the couch (going along with the Pier 1 pillow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_couch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;couch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in the afternoon- I hit a wall. Just totally completely exhausted! I took a really long nap with my new pillow and blanket. So that was great. It was also still really nice out- so for the third day in a row, I was able to open the windows and get some fresh air in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_window.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night I went to an info session at Turing. (AND I HAVE SO MUCH NEWS FOR THAT WORLD- but that&amp;rsquo;ll come in a later post). For now, just know that I got to wear my new shoes that I got for Christmas! Zac&amp;rsquo;s sister gave them to me and I love them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Zac got home on Thursday night I headed to Happy Hour at Avanti&amp;rsquo;s with a friend. She invited a huge group, and everyone brought more people. There ended up being like 20-25 of us, and everyone was really great. Before, every time we went to Avanti, I would look at the bar area thinking &amp;lsquo;I need to get here some night&amp;rsquo;, and it was definitely what I expected. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to take Zac there some time for drinks- and to introduce him to some of the people I met that night!  When Zac got on the train, I walked the two blocks home. I was so busy talking, I got NO pictures. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I got the most unexpected and perfectly timed box ever. My dear friend, who I admire and am so lucky to know, sent me a holiday/care package. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking a lot about life. Actually, we always do, and always will. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to know her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_gift1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_gift2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zac was back from LA, so in the morning we took Rex for a walk and grabbed coffee at ink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ink.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ink&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I watched a couple episodes of Lemony Snicket- while doing some work. After Zac got off work- we FINALLY went and saw Rogue One! IT WAS GREAT. We had tried to go for weeks, but the AMC Flatiron was totally sold out. I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for the lay down movie theater, so we kept waiting. We loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we went for a long walk. It was nice outside, but not great. We walked to a few different areas we hadn&amp;rsquo;t explored yet, so that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gift&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, we had tickets to the Mammoth game! We use to love going to lax games in Buffalo, and were pretty excited to have a team here in Denver. First we stopped for drinks and apps at a place called Public School 303. It was adorable! Decorated for school- they have flash cards on the walls, and menus that look like composition notebooks. Plus, the food and drinks (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; liter of wine on happy hour!) were fantastic. The wings reminded me a place my brother and I went as kids- they had the BEST wings, so that&amp;rsquo;s a high compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ps303.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;public school&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_ps3032.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;public school&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we walked to the game and had so much fun! I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go again. It was a really close game too- we won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_pc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pepsi center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_lax.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mammoth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was FOOTBALL DAY. The games were CRAZY! I am stoked that the Steelers won, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to cheer them on this weekend (and every other day, GO STEELERS!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_17/2017_01_17_dog_nap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the weekend was filled in with dog cuddles, walks, and trips to the gym. We also started watching The Man at High Castle, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a great show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll wrap up.. I have a delicious smelling coconut lemon curry to go eat. Exciting news coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone has had a great start to the year! It was a cold week here in Denver, but we had a great week nonetheless. I have been re-watching Downton Abbey&amp;ndash; on Monday I realized I could stream Amazon Video through the XBox, and I am THRILLED. Truth is, I missed the last season, and I need to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them playing pretty much all day while I work on different CodeAcademy/Computer Projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_comp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;downton&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of computer projects&amp;mdash; on Wednesday I lured a friend out for drinks so that I could question her about WebDev and local programs. She was an awesome source of information (as well as an awesome person)- and I have a lot to consider. Wednesday this coming week I am attending an info session at Turing School, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll start applying and see what happens. It might take a few tries, but I am loving everything I&amp;rsquo;m learning, and I am ready to move forward at a faster pace!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night we went to the Botanic Gardens for an Off The Clock event. The same friend above invited us, and we meet another couple there. It was a fun little night. I just LOVE walking around the gardens. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for summer- I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just go and sit a couple days a week- because. It also makes me wish I could grow things, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, keeping plants alive is not my strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_gardens.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we were planning on snowboarding, but were just too sore to make it up. Instead, we slept in and took care of some things around the apartment. In the morning, we walked to Panera Bread to get a loaf (and a Caramel Latte) to go with our bean-less Chili. I made a large batch in December and froze portions for trips to the mountain. I had already thawed one, so chili for lunch it was! Rexy loved the walk- and he gets more compliments, laughs and smiles when he wears his boots. Seriously, no one is immune to the cuteness that is dog boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got home, it was straight to the paw-wash! Of course, he was filthy, and overjoyed by the prospect of being hosed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_dogbath.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon I finished up another jar of Justin&amp;rsquo;s Almond Butter. I have been drinking SO MANY smoothies, and eating so many smoothie bowls, that I needed a cost effective option. I mentioned this to Zac, and an hour later, he was in the kitchen whipping up a batch of his first ever homemade PB! Guys- ITS AMAZING. Now, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for peanuts we can buy in bulk&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_pb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, it was FOOTBALL DAY. How about them Steelers? Gosh I am so excited about this post season. After the Steelers game, I headed to the gym- where I caught most of the Packers Giants game, and the Golden Globes Red Carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_elip.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TV&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for Restorative Yoga at Kindness. I love this weekly class- its the perfect way to wrap up a week! It was a particularly great class- and afterwards, Zac met me with Rex to walk home. Always the gentleman, he carries my Yoga mat like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://libmb.github.io/images/2017_01/2017_01_08/2017_01_08_yoga.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Gardens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s 2017 already. I will say, that being back in Denver finally feels like home and not just a vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
